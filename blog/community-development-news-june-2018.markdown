Welcome to our monthly blog update about what is happening in Apache Community Development (ComDev)!  

This month we have news about the Apache EU Roadshow and FOSS Backstage conferences in Berlin, we talk about our participation at the OpenExpo Europe, we interview speakers, attendees and Board members for FeatherCast and we prepare for participation in even more conferences.

<h2>Apache EU Roadshow</h2><p>This month our <a href="https://s.apache.org/rvjm" target="external">Apache EU Roadshow</a>  was held in Berlin. Our Apache Lounge was very popular as an informal meetup space to sit, relax, hack or generally catch up. As well as stickers our special giveaway item was ice cream which went down very well with attendees. For those who attended, we hope that you enjoyed the event. A huge thank you to all the speakers who participated at the EU Roadshow and also all the volunteers who gave up their time to make it happen. </p><p>Photos from the Roadshow and FOSS Backstage can be found at the following links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://s.apache.org/Gwl4" target="external">Event Photos</a></li></ul><p>Two of the roadshow tracks were recorded (Cloud, Http/Microservices) and are available on the Apache EU Roadshow Playlist on the  <a href="https://s.apache.org/AGvP" target="external">ASF Youtube Channel.</a>
<p>You can find all the videos from the Apache EU Roadshow at the link below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://s.apache.org/fEmT" target="external">Apache EU Roadshow Videos</a> </li></ul><p>If you have any feedback that you think could help us make our next event even better then please feel free to contact us.</p><h2>FOSS Backstage</h2><p>We also had a lot of Apache participation at FOSS Backstage. Their focus on governance, community and the legal aspects of open source is very relevant to the ASF. There were a wide range of interesting talks, discussions and workshops and you can find the videos at the link below:
<ul><li><a href="https://s.apache.org/ag06" target="external">FOSS Backstage Videos</a> </li></ul><p>We look forward to future events where we hopefully can continue to participate.</p><h2>FeatherCast Interviews</h2><p><a href="https://feathercast.apache.org/" target="external">FeatherCast</a> is the ASF podcast channel and we usually try to do interviews with speakers or attendees at events. The Apache EU Roadshow and FOSS Backstage were great places for finding interviewees. Instead of an audio recording, this time thanks to Rich Bowen, we also have video interviews. The first two interviews have already been published and you can find them at the links below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://s.apache.org/VVk2" target="external">Apache Spamassassin: Kevin McGrail</a> </li><li><a href="https://s.apache.org/IGz8" target="external">Apache Fineract: Myrle Krantz</a> </li></ul><p>These short interviews give a brief overview about the project and its community. So if you want to know a little more about either of these project then watch the interviews!</p><p>As well as interviews with conference attendees and speakers, we have started a short series of interviews called 'Board Conversations' where members of the Board of Directors for the Apache Software Foundation talk about their role.</p><ul><li><a href="https://s.apache.org/Y6QW" target="external"> What does Membership at The Apache Software Foundation mean?</a> </li><li><a href="https://s.apache.org/VDrA" target="external"> What Does the Apache Board of Directors Do?</a> </li></ul><p>We are always looking for new people to talk to and interview so if you are interested in doing a FeatherCast interview about your project or your involvement with Apache then please contact us.<p><h2>OpenExpo Europe Madrid</h2><p>This year we participated again at the <a href="https://openexpoeurope.com/" target="external>Open Expo Europe</a>. It is an event in Spain focused on open technologies, and we were pleased to see that there were several talks about Apache projects. We had some members of the community attending the event to staff the Apache booth and present talks about open source, community development and the Apache way:</p><ul><li>Luciano Resende, Piergiorgio Lucidi and Ignasi Barrera held an open debate about the <em>Challenges projects face when going open source.</em></li><li>Ismaël Mejía presented a talk (in Spanish) about <em><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fwJzargPNaC937ftGBfndV14Y4cOG11YrGfkbQTD_wU" target="external">Building software and communities the Apache Way</a></li></ul><p>You can read more details about the event, venue, and the different talks that took place in <a href="https://www.open4dev.com/journal/2018/6/7/apache-members-at-openexpo-europe-2018-wrap-up" target="external">this great blog post</a> by Piergiorgio Lucidi.</p><p>Thanks very much to everyone who helped support our participation and involvement in this event!<p><h2>Apache Booth at OSCON 2018</h2><p>We have been given a free booth at <a href="https://s.apache.org/3l1g" target="external">OSCON 2018 </a> so we will have volunteers there giving away stickers, swag and ready to talk to attendees about the ASF.
