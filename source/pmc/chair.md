The PMC Chair acts as the voice of the project to the board, and is
responsible for filing a quarterly report. They are not the project
leader, but are a peer of the other PMC members, who has been selected,
for a time, to take the role of secretary and spokesperson.

The PMC Chair is **not** the de-facto project leader. While they are
usually a senior, well-respected member of the community, they are a
peer, with a few additional duties.

The Chair should be familiar with the [assigned
duties](https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#chair) of the role.

## Secretarial duties

The Chair is responsible for completing the necessary "paperwork" when
new committers and PMC members are added. 

See the [process for adding new 
committers](https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#committer-management),
and the [process for adding new PMC 
members](https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newpmc), for details of
these requirements.

## Reporting

The Chair is also responsible for [filing the quarterly project report](/pmc/reporting) to
the board of directors.

## Moderating discussion

As the name implies, the Chair may occasionally need to step in to
moderate discussion, to ensure that a community is conducting itself
with decorum, and not straying into divisive discussion. 

The Chair has been selected because they are a respected member of the 
community, and so should not be hesitant to step in and state what the 
community standards are, and enforce the expectation that community members 
behave in appropriate ways on official communication channels.

## Selecting a new Chair

A project may periodically select a new Chair. 

Some projects do this every year or two, while others keep the same Chair 
for many years. A Chair might step down because they no longer have time
for the role, or simply to give someone else an opportunity.

Candidates for Chair should be made aware of the work load associated
with the position, to ensure that they have the availability for the
role, and clearly understand what they're getting into.

The outgoing Chair is encouraged to spend some time mentoring the
incoming Chair, and familiarizing them with the duties, to ensure their
success in the role.
