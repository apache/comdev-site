Building a thriving project community requires intentional effort.
This guide provides practical strategies to attract and engage
contributors in your project.

## Publish a roadmap

While volunteers choose their own contributions, providing direction
helps them find meaningful ways to get involved. Publishing a roadmap
or wishlist of desired features and improvements gives potential
contributors clear entry points.

A roadmap demonstrates that your project has clear goals and
momentum, signaling growth rather than stagnation.

Keeping a roadmap current can be challenging. Consider implementing
a mechanism for tagging open issues with `proposal` or `roadmap`
labels and automatically extracting them into a web page to
streamline this process.

## Periodically publish the open issue list

Regularly share summaries of open issues from your ticket tracker
with the dev@ list. This reminds contributors that work is available
and encourages them to get involved.

Consider creating [good first
issues](/committers/good-first-issues.html) as entry points for new
contributors.

## Clearly document contribution processes

Ensure your contribution documentation -- covering how to contribute,
build, test, and submit pull requests -- is clear and easy to follow.
Experienced committers often overlook the institutional knowledge
they take for granted, so regularly review your "getting started"
documentation from a newcomer's perspective.

Encourage new contributors to share and document their pain points
during their first contributions. Work toward addressing or at least
documenting these challenges to improve the experience for future
contributors.

Do not neglect non-code contributions as you think about where people
can get involved.

## Publish your contributor ladder

A [contributor ladder](/contributor-ladder.html) describes the various
levels of access and responsibility contributors can progress through
in your project -- typically from contributor to committer to PMC member.

Clearly document requirements for each level. For example, if you require
ten substantial patches or three months of involvement, publish these
criteria on your website. This prevents contributors from feeling the
process is arbitrary or unclear.

Consider lowering your entry barriers. Remember that inviting someone
"too early" risks temporary issues that version control can fix, but
inviting someone too late risks losing them permanently.

## Engage with big users

Reach out to companies that depend on your project and ask them to consider
what would happen if the project were discontinued. This often leads
organizations to recognize the value they receive and motivates them
to start contributing in meaningful ways.

## Be transparent about project risk

If your project faces retirement due to insufficient community engagement,
communicate this openly. Tell your dev and user lists about the specific
risks and where you need help. Think about non-code needs that your
project has, and be specific about how these could be addressed.

While many users are content to consume your project passively, awareness
of project risks often motivates them to contribute.

challenges. While we don't have all the answers, we can help you analyze
problems and explore potential solutions.
