The Project Management Committee, or PMC, is the technical steering
committee for a project. Each PMC determines the roadmap for their
project, decides who will be added as committers and PMC members, 
votes on new project software releases, and
reports quarterly to the Board of Directors.

The Board expects all PMCs to understand and comply with [published 
policies](https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#policy).

## PMC Responsibilities

The PMC is responsible for the management of the project. This includes
both the technical decisions and ensuring that the project is operating
in community-friendly ways.  PMCs are also responsible for managing 
their project's brand and trademarks.

The PMC is also responsible for voting on releases of their project, to
ensure that each release is tested and is an official ASF release
artifact.
