The Project Management Committee, or PMC, is the technical steering
committee for a project. This group determines the roadmap for the
project, decides who will be added as committers and PMC members, and
reports quarterly to the Board of Directors.

The Board expects all PMCs to understand and comply with [published 
policies](https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#policy).

## PMC Responsibilities

The PMC is responsible for the management of the project. This includes
both the technical decisions, and ensuring that the project is operating
in community-friendly ways.

The PMC is also responsible for voting on releases of their project, to
ensure that each release is tested, and is an official ASF release
artifact.

## Chair

The PMC Chair acts as the voice of the project to the board, and is
responsible for filing a quarterly report. They are not the project
leader, but are a peer of the other PMC members, who has been selected,
for a time, to take the role of secretary and spokesperson.

## Voting

there are a number of situations in which a vote is necessary. You can
read more about voting on the [ASF main
website](https://apache.org/foundation/voting.html).

## Infrastructure services

The ASF Infrastructure team offers a wide variety of
[services](https://infra.apache.org/services.html) to your project,
which may be requested by PMC members. Familiarize yourself with those
services!

## Reporting

A PMC is required to file a report to the Board of Directors every
quarter, on a schedule determined by the Board. [Read more about what
goes into a PMC report](/pmc/reporting.html).

## Adding committers

The addition of committers is essential to the long-term 
sustainability of an open source project. The PMC is responsible for
determining who will be added as a committer. [Read more about how new
committers are added to a project](/pmc/adding-committers.html).

## Adding PMC members

The PMC members identify project participants who they want to be
members of the PMC. [Read more about the process of adding new PMC
