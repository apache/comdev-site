# Employing or Contracting with Open Source Contributors

If your business relies on an open source project, employing, contracting with or
otherwise financially supporting,
contributors to the project is the most effective way to ensure that
your priorities are reflected in project decisions. 
(See also [Recruiting and Employee 
Satisfaction](/companies/benefits.html#recruiting-and-employee-satisfaction))

This goes [far beyond code contributions](/contributors/non-code.html), 
although that is the most obvious and visible way that you can participate.

Think of staffing an open source project exactly the same way you would
think about staffing an internal software development project or working with external contractors. What
positions would you staff if you weren't sharing the load with the
community? Are those positions being adequately covered?

Dedicating employee or contractors' time to positions like marketing, events, and
end-user support, as well as software development, significantly
increases your influence and trust in the project community.

## Effective Ways to Contribute

While many companies contribute here and there to open source projects,
having a carefully considered strategy for doing so will lead to more
consistent, measurable results, and greater influence in the project's
decisions and roadmap.

### Allocate Dedicated Time

Earning trust in open source projects takes consistent engagement, and
visibility to the community. Thus, having guaranteed dedicated time to
focus on upstream work will result in better long-term results.

Giving employees a specific time allocation - 10-20% of their schedule
is typical - will ensure that they remain visible to the community, and
are able to have focused time to build their skills.

Trust earned by one contributor does not necessarily rub off on your 
other employees. So don't assume that you can just swap out one employee
for another.

### Recognize Contributions

Include open source contributions in performance reviews and career 
advancement considerations. Define specific metrics, such as PRs
accepted, reviews, public speaking engagements, or promotion to
committer or PMC member, which are tied to promotion opportunities. This
will help employees feel appreciated, and communicate that engagement in
open source projects is not considered charity or altruism, but is a key
part of company goals.

### Support Conference and Meetup Participation

Fund employee attendance at relevant conferences and encourage speaking
opportunities. Understand that attending conferences is primarily about
creating opportunities to collaborate with peers, and this, in turn,
will accelerate your business priorities.


## Support Individual Contributors

Supporting individual contributors financially (via B2B contracts, 
individual sponsorships, fellowships, and third party sponsor programs)
can be a very effective way to contribute to a project if you don't have
full-time positions available on your payroll.

### Bug Bounties

While the ASF does not ever directly pay for contributions to ASF
projects, as a matter of principle, there are many third-party "bug
bounty" sites that allow you to support individual contributors in their
work on projects that you care about.

The project
[bug-bounty-platforms](https://github.com/disclose/bug-bounty-platforms)
maintains a list of such sites, along with contact information. The ASF
does not endorse any of these sites, but developers are welcome to work
with them as they contribute to ASF projects.

### Sponsor and Internship Programs

There are many third-party programs through which you can support
contributors to open source projects, with [GitHub
Sponsors](https://github.com/open-source/sponsors) being one of the
best-known.

Internship programs such as [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/)
provide opportunties for individuals to work a paid internship for an
open source project. Companies can support these organizations, and thus
indirectly fund work on projects that they care about.

## Project Independence

Project independence is a central tenet of the ASF, and one of the most
common places that companies misstep in their interactions with ASF
projects.

Take time to understand ASF ethos, the [ASF Trademark
Policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/), and the reasons why
we value project independence. Trust takes a long time to earn, but can
be burned very quickly by misusing a project's brand.

There are several very practical ways that you can contribute to overall
project health, while earning trust for your contributors.

### Broad Project Ownership

Ensure contributions align with long-term project goals rather than 
solely short-term company priorities. That ensures that the project as a
whole remains healthy.

Companies that focus only on contributions that support their own
specific business model quickly identify themselves as not valuing the
overall health of the project. It also makes it very difficult to
attract broader community interest in your proposed changes, since they
are seen as self-serving.

### Chop Wood, Carry Water (Routine Maintenance)

Open source communities sometimes use the phrase "chop wood, carry
water" to talk about doing the mundane maintenance tasks that are
required to keep a project going.

Many companies focus only on the flashy new features, and ignore the
fact that a software project needs daily care to keep going.

#### Triage

Participating in the weekly triage of new issue reports and pull
requests keeps a project healthy. It ensures that the project does not
appear abandoned. And it exposes your team to parts of the project on
which they would not otherwise gain expertise.

It also identifies your contributors as people who care about the
overall health of the project, which, in turn, earns trust and increases
the community's willingness to work with you.

Be sure to explicitly give your employees time to do these tasks.

#### Infrastructure

While the physical infrastructure behind ASF projects is maintained by a
[team of paid professionals](https://infra.apache.org/), there's more to
project infrastructure than that. Keeping the CI system running
effectively, understanding what supplementary infrastructure the project
depends, on, and generally being useful are key ways to ensure the
sustainability of the project.

For projects that provide infrastructure, or other cloud services,
donating these to the project (talk to infra about how!) is critical to
the health of ASF projects.

#### User Support

Answering user questions is the very best way to understand the pain
that your own customers are experiencing with the project. It will make
you more responsive to them, and build your own expertise, in a way that
no other activity will do.

### Transparency

Many companies value secrecy in their roadmap, as they believe that it
gives them a competitive advantage in the market.

This is in tension with the open source focus on transparency and
collaboration. Finding an appropriate balance is key to your successful
participation in ASF projects.

Being transparent about your company priorities has several positive
outcomes.

#### Avoid Conflicts

Telling the project what you will be working on can avoid conflicting
with other work that is going in a different direction. The project can
discuss your plans, and compromise on a mutually agreed direction,
saving you time going down a path which will ultimately get rejected.

#### Attract Collaborators

It can be a way to identify people from outside your organization who
share the same priority, who may work with you to achieve your goals,
and, in the process, provide ideas and innovation that you may have
missed had you done the work yourself behind your company walls.

#### Earn Trust

It always comes back to earning trust. Being transparent about your
priorities shows the project what you care about. It doesn't leave them
guessing about your ulterior motives. The more you do this, and the more
you live up to what you say you're going to do, the more the project
will be willing to work with you.

## Getting Started

1. Identify projects your company already uses or depends on
2. Connect with existing contributors in your organization
3. Start with small, manageable contributions
4. Consider sending a weekly/monthly update to the project dev list
   about what you're focusing on. (Discuss this with the project first
   to be sure it's welcome.)
5. Build relationships within project communities
6. Gradually increase involvement and responsibility (See [Becoming a
   committer](/contributors/becomingacommitter.html))

*Companies that invest in employing open source contributors create a sustainable model that benefits the entire ecosystem while building internal expertise and community relationships.*
