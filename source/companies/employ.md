# Employing Open Source Contributors

If your business relies on an open source project, employing
contributors to the project is the most effective way to ensure that
your priorities influence project decisions. (See
[Recruiting and Employee Satisfaction](/companies/benefits.html#recruiting-and-employee-satisfaction)

This goes [far beyond code contributions](/contributors/non-code.html), 
although that is the most obvious and visible way that you can participate.

## Effective ways to contribute

While many companies contribute here and there to open source projects,
having a carefully considered strategy for doing so will lead to more
consistent, measurable results, and greater influence in the project's
decisions and roadmap.

### Allocate Dedicated Time

Earning trust in open source projects takes consistent engagement, and
visibility to the community. Thus, having guaranteed dedicated time to
focus on upstream work will result in better long-term results.

Giving employees a specific time allocation - 10-20% of their schedule
is typical - will ensure that they remain visible to the community, and
are able to have focused time to build their skills.

Trust earned by one contributor does not necessarily rub off on your 
other employees. So don't assume that you can just swap out one employee
for another.

### Recognize Contributions

Include open source contributions in performance reviews and career 
advancement considerations. Define specific metrics, such as PRs
accepted, reviews, public speaking engagements, or promotion to
committer or PMC member, which are tied to promotion opportunities. This
will help employees feel appreciated, and communicate that engagement in
open source projects is not considered charity or altruism, but is a key
part of company goals.

### Support Conference and Meetup Participation

Fund employee attendance at relevant conferences and encourage speaking
opportunities. Understand that attending conferences is primarily about
creating opportunities to collaborate with peers, and this, in turn,
will accelerate your business priorities.

### Respect Project Independence

Take time to understand ASF ethos, the [ASF Trademark
Policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/), and the reasons why
we value project independence. Trust takes a long time to earn, but can
be burned very quickly by misusing a project's brand.

Ensure contributions align with long-term project goals rather than 
solely short-term company priorities. That ensures that the project as a
whole remains healthy.

## Getting Started

1. Identify projects your company already uses or depends on
2. Connect with existing contributors in your organization
3. Start with small, manageable contributions
4. Build relationships within project communities
5. Gradually increase involvement and responsibility (See [Becoming a
   committer](/contributors/becomingacommitter.html))

Companies that invest in employing open source contributors create a sustainable model that benefits the entire ecosystem while building internal expertise and community relationships.
