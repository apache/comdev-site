# Employing Open Source Contributors

If your business relies on an open source project, employing
contributors to the project is the most effective way to ensure that
your priorities influence project decisions.

This goes [far beyond code contributions](/contributors/non-code.html), 
although that is the most obvious and visible way that you can participate.

## Effective ways to contribute

### Allocate Dedicated Time
Allow employees to spend work time on open source contributions, typically 10-20% of their schedule.

### Recognize Contributions
Include open source contributions in performance reviews and career advancement considerations.

### Support Conference Participation
Fund employee attendance at relevant conferences and encourage speaking opportunities.

### Respect Project Independence
Ensure contributions align with long-term project goals rather than solely short-term company priorities.

### Long-term Commitment

Earning individual trust takes long-term participation. Trust earned by
one contributor does not necessarily rub off on your other employees.

## Getting Started

1. Identify projects your company already uses or depends on
2. Connect with existing contributors in your organization
3. Start with small, manageable contributions
4. Build relationships within project communities
5. Gradually increase involvement and responsibility

Companies that invest in employing open source contributors create a sustainable model that benefits the entire ecosystem while building internal expertise and community relationships.
