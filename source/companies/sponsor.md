# Financial Sponsorship

The sustainability of our projects relies on consistent funding for
infrastructure, legal services, marketing, events, and many other
expenses. Financial sponsorship is a direct way to participate in
keeping the lights on.

Companies can sponsor the ASF with an [annual
donation](https://apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html), 
[conferences sponsorship](https://communityovercode.org),
targeted donations to a particular project, or in-kind donations of
products or services.

Supporting local gatherings of open source enthusiasts is a great way to
foster community growth, and can help your company attract and retain
experts in your employ.
