# Financial Sponsorship

The sustainability of our projects relies on consistent funding for
infrastructure, legal services, marketing, events, and many other
expenses. Financial sponsorship is a direct way to participate in
keeping the lights on.

## ASF Sponsorship

Companies can sponsor the ASF with an [annual
donation](https://apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html), 
[conferences sponsorship](https://communityovercode.org),
targeted donations to a particular project, or in-kind donations of
products or services.

## Event and meetup sponsorship

In addition to the [main ASF conference](https://communityovercode.org),
many ASF projects have their own events. These are usually listed on
[events.apache.org](https://events.apache.org), and announced within the
project community itself.

Sponsoring, and speaking at, these events, is perhaps the fastest way to
raise your profile in a project community, and for your employees to
earn trust and visibility within the project.

Supporting local gatherings of open source enthusiasts is a great way to
foster community growth, and can help your company attract and retain
experts in your employ.

See also the [Apache Local
Communities](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/Apache+Local+Community+-+ALC)
for local and regional groups where you can engage with other ASF
enthusiasts.
