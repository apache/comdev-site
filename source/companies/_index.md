# Why your company should participate in ASF projects

All modern digital infrastructure is dependent on open source software,
and **ASF projects are everywhere**.
Companies must think strategically about how they will engage with the
open source projects on which they rely in order to ensure
sustainability, and **influence the direction of these projects** for the
benefit of their customers.

strategic and operational benefits to companies, including talent
