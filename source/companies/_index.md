# Companies and Open Source

All modern digital infrastructure is dependent on open source software.
Companies must think strategically about how they will engage with the
open source projects on which they rely in order to ensure
sustainability, and influence the direction of these projects for the
benefit of their customers.

## [Benefits to Companies](/companies/benefits.html)

Active participation in open source projects provides significant strategic and operational benefits to companies, from talent acquisition to technology innovation and market positioning.

## Ways to contribute

There are three primary ways that companies can engage with ASF
projects. Each has costs and benefits that should be carefully
considered.

The most effective way companies support ASF projects is by employing 
developers, and other professionals, who contribute directly to
projects. This includes not just code contributions, but 
documentation, community management, testing, design, and advocacy work.
