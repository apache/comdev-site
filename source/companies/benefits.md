# Benefits of ASF Participation

Companies that actively participate in ASF projects realize significant
strategic and operational advantages that extend far beyond cost savings.
It's important to think strategically about how, where, and why you will
participate and measure impact. It can be challenging to justify these
benefits to management, as many of them are long-term. And these benefits
will vary greatly depending on the nature of your business.

### Recruiting

By working upstream on projects, you directly showcase to potential
employees what they might be working on. This helps attract the right
kind of talent to work on your priorities, and they'll begin to see your
company as a partner in the project, and an attractive place to work.

Being involved in the day-to-day life of the project
gives you direct access to the most qualified people in the world to
work on your team. And you know they'll be arriving with the skills you
need.

## Business and Strategic Advantages

For more than 25 years, the ASF has been a place where industry
standards have been set and implemented. Collaborating in those
projects is the most effective way to shape industry standards and best
practices. You'll be building trust with current and potential
customers, and building strategic partnerships with other companies
working in the same space.

*The benefits of open source participation compound over time, creating sustainable competitive advantages and fostering innovation that drives long-term business success.*
