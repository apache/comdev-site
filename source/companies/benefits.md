# Benefits of ASF Participation

Companies that actively participate in ASF projects realize significant
strategic and operational advantages that extend far beyond cost savings.
It's important to think strategically about how, where, and why you will
participate and measure impact.

## Influence the roadmap

While it can sometimes take months, or years, to gain expertise and
trust in an established community, showing up to do the daily
project maintenance -- issue and PR triage; reviewing PRs; planning and
executing community events; answering user questions -- you'll quickly
begin to establish that you can be trusted, which will make it easier
for you to influence the direction of the project.
    
Decisions about the direction of Apache projects are made by the people
who show up to participate in the conversation. If you don't join the
conversation, then your competitors will decide how tomorrow's
technology will shape up.

Make sure someone on your team is reading the project [mailing
lists](https://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html) every day,
and advocating for your priorities. That's what community means --
showing up to own the future of the project.

While trust does not necessarily transfer to other employees, over time,
as project participants see your company actively contributing to the
project, and demonstrating ownership, they'll be more willing to work
with you.

## Recruiting

By working upstream on projects, you directly showcase to potential
employees what they might be working on. This helps attract the right
kind of talent to work on your priorities, and they'll begin to see your
company as a partner in the project, and an attractive place to work.

Being involved in the day-to-day life of the project
gives you direct access to the most qualified people in the world to
work on your team. And you know they'll be arriving with the skills you
need.

## Business and Strategic Advantages

For more than 25 years, the ASF has been a place where industry
standards have been set and implemented. Collaborating in those
projects is the most effective way to shape industry standards and best
practices. You'll be building trust with current and potential
customers, and building strategic partnerships with other companies
working in the same space.

And by collaborating with your peers on the common tasks, you'll be able
to better focus on what is your unique business differentiators.
Collaborate on what all share; Compete where you excel.

*The benefits of open source participation compound over time, creating
sustainable competitive advantages and fostering innovation that drives 
long-term business success.*
