# Open Source Advocacy

Since the earliest days of the Apache Software Foundation, companies
have built their business and reputation around ASF projects, and we
have always encouraged that. We, in turn, depends on the good will of
companies. How companies speak about ASF projects is a critical part of
our public image.

## Respect Our Brands

Like any organization, the ASF has [Trademark
Policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/) which describes
appropriate and inappropriate ways to use the brand of the ASF, and of
ASF projects. We expect companies to familiarize themselves with these
policies, just as they would when working with another company or
partner.

## Be Proactive About Education

Be sure that anyone speaking on behalf of your company understands
and respects the [ASF Trademark
Policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/). Most violations of
these policies have historically come from company spokespeople who do
not understand the nature of the ASF, or of open source software, and
speak of our projects like just another of your company's products.

Be proactive about educating these individuals about appropriate ways to
speak about these projects. Use this website as a reference, and
encourage them to talk directly to projects if they have any questions
about how best to represent your work in and around these communities.

## Community First

When you mention ASF projects, we ask that you put the community first.
It's great to celebrate what your company and employees are doing in and
around ASF projects - we welcome and encourage that! - but be sure to
give credit where it's due. The community as a whole makes our projects
work, and contributes to your success.

Some companies make claims about their involvement in ASF projects that
imply that they own the project, or are primarily responsible for it.
Phrases like "creators of ..." or "primary contributors to ..." devalue
the work that the rest of the community does, and unfairly take credit
for the work that others have done to contribute to your success. We ask
that you not do that.
