ComDev manages a number of helpful tools for finding your way around.

  - The [Apache Projects Directory](https://projects.apache.org/) lists all our software projects.  [See the Project Directory **code**](https://projects.apache.org/about.html) and the JSON data feeds available.
  - [Apache Committers Phone Book](https://home.apache.org/) lists all individual Apache committers.  [See the Phonebook **code**](https://home.apache.org/phonebook-about.html).
  - The [Project Reporting Tool](https://reporter.apache.org/) (requires login) helps Apache PMCs create quarterly board reports.  [See the Reporter **code**](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/projects.apache.org/).
  - The [ComDev Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/ComDev+Wiki) is also available for scratch or experimental work, although most permanent content should be here in the website.

The ComDev PMC maintains these tools, so bring questions to our [dev@](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@community.apache.org) list.
