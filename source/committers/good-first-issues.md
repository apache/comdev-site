# What are "Good First Issues"?

GFI or "Good First Issues" are a good way to start on an OSS project, and a official Github initiative. Several GitHub repositories use this label to encourage new contributors to start helping the project without the necessity, in most cases, to contact one of the contributors in advance or to have a deep knowledge of the project architecture or content.


### How can I identify a GFI?
GFI's are usually flagged in the GitHub projects and normally simple tasks that can be accomplished detached from other dependencies. It can be a small code enhancement, documenting internal functions, creating small APIs to connect services, documentation, and others. 


Here you can find some Apache projects with GFI:
- [Apache Beam](https://github.com/apache/beam/contribute)
- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow/contribute)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset/contribute)
- [Apache Iceberg](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/contribute)
- [Apache Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-18868?jql=project%20%3D%20Cassandra%20AND%20(complexity%20%3D%20%22Low%20Hanging%20Fruit%22%20or%20labels%20%3D%20%22lhf%22)%20and%20assignee%20is%20Empty%20and%20status%20not%20in%20(Resolved%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22))
