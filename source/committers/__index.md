There are a number of useful Apache tools and services available for Apache projects
 and committers.  This is a brief set of pointers or signposts to information elsewhere.

## Apache Infrastructure Information

The primary portals for Apache Infra questions - how Subversion/Git/Websites, etc. work at the ASF - are pages at <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/" target="_blank">apache.org/dev</a> and <a href="https://www.infra.apache.org" target="_blank">infra.apache.org</a>.

If you're a committer, you can [patch this very website yourself][2]!

## Decision making

Decisions in Apache projects are the result of:

  - action
  - consensus in the community 
  - (if needed) votes within the community

We have, over the years, developed a very simple and effective approach to 
consensus building and decision making. The vast majority of decisions are made
using [lazy consensus][3], if the "lazy" approach to consensus building is deemed
unsuitable for a particular decision then we seek to [build consensus][4] within
the community. Very occasionally, usually for formal reasons relating to legal 
responsibilities, it is necessary to call a [vote][5].

Each of these three approaches is described more fully on various foundation 
and project sites. However, we've provided an initial introduction to [decision
making][6] here on the community development site.

## Project independence

While not all aspects of the Apache Way are practiced the same way by 
all projects at the ASF, there are a number of rules that Apache 
projects are required to follow â€“ things like complying with PMC 
[release voting][7], [legal policy][8], [brand policy][9], 
using [mailing lists][10], etc., which are [documented in various places][11]. 

One of these invariant rules is that projects are managed and used
independently of any commercial interests. The goal is to create an 
environment in which all participants are equal and thus have an equal
opportunity to contribute to and benefit from our software, regardless
of motivation or financial objectives. This is discussed in more detail
in our document [Project Independence][12].

## Development processes

Each project in Apache is free to define its own development processes as 
long as they respect our decision making, legal and independence requirements.
However, over the many years that the ASF has existed many best practices have 
evolved and been documented across out projects. In this section we will try to 
bring together some of the most popular of these practices. Most Apache projects
operate in ways that are largely similar to these processes.

  * [Crediting contributors][13] is a critical part of community building
  * [ASF Licensing Policy][14]
  * Releases
    * [Releases FAQ][15]
    * Release audit is a process each release candidate must go through to ensure IP is correctly managed
      * [RAT/Creadur][16] is a tool to assist this process
    * [Release management][17] is the process by which releases are prepared and released
    * [Handling cryptography][18] in an Apache Release
    * [Source Headers and NOTICE][19] Files
    * [Distribution best practices][20]
  * [ASF Developer section sitemap][21]

## Assisting with project management and marketing

There are many visible contributions of value in an Apache projects
(documentation, testing, coding user support, design etc.), but there are
also plenty of "back office" tasks that are necessary to maintain a healthy
project. This section describes some of the activities that you can help
with. In most cases you will need to be a committer to carry out these
activities, although non-committers can often act in supporting roles.

 * Write informational [blogs][22]
 * [Assessing and approving new committers](/newcommitter.html)
 * [Board Reports](/boardreport.html)
 * [Apache Project Branding/Trademark Resources](http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/resources)

## Speaking about Apache projects at Events

We encourage all of our committers to speak about Apache Projects, 
Technologies, and generally help to grow and enhance our community.
For more information on getting started, see our 
[Speakers section](/speakers/).

In addition, we also encourage all committers to list themselves as
["Local Mentors"](/localmentors.html), and thus help out new committers
and would be committers. For more information on what this program involves,
and how to sign yourself up for it, please see the 
[Local Mentors](/localmentors.html) page.
