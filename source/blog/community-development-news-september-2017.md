Welcome to our monthly blog update about what is happening in Apache Community Development (ComDev)! You may have
noticed that we missed our August issue, this was due to preparations and participation at the Solutions Hamburg
conference so once again we have a double update for you this month.

This month we have news about the FOSS Backstage Micro Summit, we share our experience of the Solutions Hamburg
conference, and we start preparing for two conferences in October - the Open Source Summit and MesosCon.

### FOSS Backstage Micro Summit

FOSS Backstage is "a conference on everything related to governance, collaboration, legal and economics within the scope
of Free and Open Source (FOSS)". A micro summit will be talking place in Berlin on 20th November and the conference
schedule has been announced. A list of the presentations is as follows:

* Open Source and Trusting the Water
* Open Source Licensing for Rocket Scientists
* Building distributed systems in distributed teams
* The hateful 20
* How mentoring projects can help newcomers get started with Open Source
* Open Source: Access or Contribution?
* Training our team in the ApacheWay
* Ant's Community - Looking Back and Current State
* Beware of geeks bearing gifts
* Asynchronous Decision Making – why and how?

### Solutions Hamburg

In early September we were invited to present a 3 day track filled with Apache content. We were allocated was at a
university campus where most of the technical talks were held and had a mix of talks in both in English and German.
Approximately 5000 conference tickets had been sold for the conference yet attendance was mixed. The most popular of our
talks were microservices related which attracted approximately 20 people.

The talk around open source licencing was also well attended with many people keen to ask questions. We had prepared a
German version of the ASF information brochure and it was very useful for giving people some general background about
the focus and role of the ASF within open source.

The organisers were great and provided everyone with lots of food, coffee and evening events. This was the first time we
had a complete track at this conference so the next step will be to start a discussion about how we could improve our
participation and attract more attendees.

A huge thank you to our 9 speakers (Justin McClean, Mark Struberg, Benedikt Ritter,Jacek Laskowski, Lars Francke, Myrle
Krantz, Christofer Dutz, Sharan Foga, Greg Stein) and a very special thank you to Myrle Krantz and Chris Dutz for their
work in organising, facilitating and generally liaising with the conference organisers.

We have received some pictures from the official event photographers and will be publishing them on our Facebook page
soon.
