If you are looking for speakers for an event, or are a speaker looking for 
materials, this is the place for you.

## ASF branded events

If you are seeking to organise an ASF-branded event, you must ensure your activities 
conform to the
[Third Party Event Branding Policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events.html). 

Once you have verified you are in conformance, contact dev@community.apache.org to get your event added to
the [events calendar](https://events.apache.org/).

## Speakers on ASF topics

Our [ASF volunteers](/contributors/asf-volunteers.html) page lists potential speakers
for ASF-related topics. ASF committers are welcome to add their name there.

If you are speaking as an official representative of the ASF, please
read the
[Speaking Guidelines for Officers](https://www.apache.org/press/guides/officer-speaking-guide.html)

## Speaker support materials

If you are creating your own slides, you will find the
[ASF Press Kit](https://www.apache.org/foundation/press/kit/)
useful. It contains logos in various formats.

A few people have shared [ASF related presentations](slides.html) for you.

If you have a slide deck under a permissive license 
that talks about ASF communities, best practices, or the like 
(i.e. one that is applicable to more than just one project 
at the ASF), please get in touch to suggest that we include your slides.

If you want to prepare a new presentation about any ASF project, feel free to start using [ASF slide templates](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/slide-templates/).

## Speaker coaching and mentoring

The ComDev committee provides several types of speaker coaching for
speakers at events related to ASF projects and topics:

* Reviewing and improving titles and abstracts you're planning to submit
  to a call for presentations (CFP)
* Reviewing your slides to make recommentations
* Dress rehearsal for your talk, to suggest improvements

This is staffed by a number of volunteers with varying availability. If
you want to take advantage of any of these services, please ask on [the
comdev mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/list?dev@community.apache.org).
