title: Apache-related slides, videos and presentations
---

This page contains links to presentations and other key papers about the ASF and how
Apache projects work that you may find useful.  Many of these have
been presented at [ApacheCon conferences](https://events.apache.org) or
other open source conferences.

These presentations are available under permissive licenses; please see
each individual presentation for license details.

Many Apache speakers post their slides to the [SlideShare website](//www.slideshare.net/search/slideshow?searchfrom=header&q=apache+software),
and the [FeatherCast podcast offers audio recordings](//feathercast.apache.org/) of many talks and interviews.

For those who prefer videos, our many volunteers have posted
  - [full videos of all ApacheCon NA 2013 presentations](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheApacheFoundation/playlists), and
  - [select ApacheCon NA 2014 presentations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU2OcwpQkYCzvGxZgVOunTs-3iEao6YJc).
  - [Sessions from ApacheCon 2019 and 2020](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLDJ_V9KUOdOFSbDvPfGBxw)

Additional slides, videos and audio recordings can also be found through the
[ApacheCon Past Conference Resources page](https://wiki.apache.org/apachecon/Past_Conference_Resources).
