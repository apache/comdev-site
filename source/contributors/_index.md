Contributing to an Apache project is the second step on your journey up
the [contributor ladder](/contributor-ladder.html).

User &rarr; **Contributor** &rarr; [Committer](/committers/) &rarr; [PMC member](/pmc/)

While we often think of contributions to open source as *code*, a 
contribution can be anything - good questions, documentation, design,
event coordination, and so on also qualify as contributions. Projects
need your skills, even if you're not a programmer.

But, it can sometimes be hard to know where to get started. We're here
to help. Here's some of the basics.

## What projects can I contribute to?

Most contributors start as users, and then see something that they want
to improve, fix, or otherwise help out with.

There's [a lot of projects](https://projects.apache.org/). You can look
through them 
[by name](https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?name),
[by topic](https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?category),
or [by programming language](https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?language).

## Where is everything?

Every [Apache project](https://projects.apache.org/) website *should*
have an **/about** page (or similar) that lists the basic "where is 
everything" about the project. If they don't, here's where to start looking:

### Download

Most (not all) Apache projects will have a prominent download link on
the front page of their project website. This will (hopefully) be
accompanied by instructions on how to download, build, install, and use
the releases.

Getting to know how to use the software that a project releases is a
reasonable first step towards contributing. Keep notes of that first
user experience, as that is valuable information for the project, and
might be a good place to start your contributions.

### What can I contribute?

Most people's first thought when contributing to open source projects is
code. And, indeed, that's where most people get involved. Most (not all) 
Apache projects have their code on [GitHub](https://github.com/apache).
Search for the project name in the **apache** GitHub organization.

There are, however, many other areas where you can contribute to a
project. Projects should identify, recruit for, and celebrate contributions in
all of these areas, and reward non-code contributors with the same
rights and privileges that they do for code contributors. [Read more
about non-code contribution opportunities](non-code.html).

### Communication

Most (not all) Apache project have their main discussions on [mailing
lists][11]. Most projects have
`users@project.apache.org` and `dev@project.apache.org` mailing lists,
focused, respectively, on end-user questions, and development activity.
You can read the archives (i.e., messages from the past), as well as
participate in current discussions, either by subscribing to the lists,
or by using the [lists.apache.org][11] site
directly.

<!--

TODO:

All of this stuff about mailing lists should be in mailing-lists.md
rather than here.

-->

#### Subscribe

To subscribe (that is, to receive every message sent to the list via
email) to a project mailing list (e.g., if you want to subscribe
to the `users` list for `PROJECT`)
send a blank email message to `users-subscribe@PROJECT.apache.org`.
Substitute the name of the list (i.e., `dev` instead of `users`), and of 
the specific project you're interested in (i.e., `karaf` instead of
`PROJECT`).

#### Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe, the process is similar. Send a blank email message to
`users-unsubscribe@PROJECT.apache.org` from the email address with which
you subscribed.

In each case, you'll receive a confirmation email, with further
instructions.

#### Other communication channels

Some projects use other communication channels, such as Slack, Discord,
or WeChat. This will (hopefully) be listed on the project page.

## Your First Contribution

Most first contributions are simple, as you become familiar with the
project and its specific contributor flow.

We recommend that you start by finding, and joining, the relevant
communication channel. Introduce yourself, and say what you're
interested in working on. How people respond to this can be a good
indicator of how welcoming the project is. It will also be an
opportunity for them to point you to [good first
issues](https://community.apache.org/committers/good-first-issues.html),
or other possible things to work on.

Your beginner's impression of the project, and the development process,
can be very valuable to projects attempting to improve their onboarding
experience, so take notes of the things that were hard to find, or
processes that you found confusing.

## Becoming a Committer

Any contributor can, eventually, become a committer. While the exact
process, and the specific milestones you may need to achieve, will vary
from one project to another, the basics are fairly consistent across the
ASF.

Ideally, once someone has contributed consistently, and of a
consistently high quality, to a project, they will get invited to become
a committer, which grants a higher level of ownership of the project.

Being a committer does not necessarily mean you commit code, although
that is the historical reason that we use this particular word.
It means you are *committed* to the project and are productively 
contributing to its success.

We've written a [guide on how to become an Apache
committer](/contributors/becomingacommitter.html) which covers the basics. As you
become more familiar with a specific project, though, you'll see that
each project has its own slightly different culture.

In general, we have some [etiquette and behavior expectations][8] when 
you work with ASF communities.

For more details see "[How it works][9]".  You can also make 
[suggestions for how to update this website][10] you're reading right now!

## Questions and Feedback

If you have other questions, the ComDev team is here to help.

You can provide feedback and ask questions by subscribing to our mailing
list: send an email to 
[dev-subscribe@community.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@community.apache.org). 
Once subscribed, you can send email to [dev@community.apache.org](mailto:dev@community.apache.org), 
or through the [lists.apache.org web
interface](https://lists.apache.org/lists.html?dev@community.apache.org).

## Project Independence And Policies

While not all ASF projects practice all aspects of the Apache Way in the 
same way, there are a number of rules that ASF projects must follow – things
like complying with PMC [release voting][2], [legal policy][3], [brand policy][4], 
using [mailing lists][5], etc., which are [documented in various places][6]. 

One of these invariant rules is that projects are managed
independently of any commercial interests. The goal is to create an
environment in which all participants are equal and thus have an equal
opportunity to contribute to and benefit from our software, regardless
of motivation or financial objectives. This is discussed in more detail
in our document [Project Independence][7].
