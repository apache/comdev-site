This page is for people who are reasonably 
comfortable with open source development models but need a helping hand finding 
their way around the Apache Software Foundation and our way of developing software
(commonly called "The Apache Way"). For those wishing to start from
the very beginning, we have a [newcomers page][1].

## Project Independence And Policies

While not all ASF projects practice all aspects of the Apache Way in the same way, there are a number of rules that Apache 
projects must follow â€“ things like complying with PMC 
[release voting][2], [legal policy][3], [brand policy][4], 
using [mailing lists][5], etc., which are [documented in various places][6]. 

One of these invariant rules is that projects are managed
independently of any commercial interests. The goal is to create an
environment in which all participants are equal and thus have an equal
opportunity to contribute to and benefit from our software, regardless
of motivation or financial objectives. This is discussed in more detail
in our document [Project Independence][7].

## Communication on mailing lists

Development at the ASF has traditionally been done on mailing lists.
This is not merely because we've always done it this way, but is an
intentional decision, in order to include a wider community than who
happens to be on your Slack channel at a particular moment.

This is why we say, at the ASF, [**If it didn't happen on the mailing
list, it didn't happen**](/contributors/mailing-lists).

## Moving From Contributor to Committer

Anyone can be a contributor to an Apache project. Being a contributor simply means
that you take an interest in the project and contribute in some way, ranging from asking
sensible questions (which document the project and provide feedback to developers)
through to providing new features as code patches.

If you become a valuable contributor to the project, the Project Management Committee (PMC) may invite you to become
a _committer_. At the ASF, a committer is someone who is
committed to a particular project. It brings with it the privilege of write access to
the project repository and resources. In many projects, committers may also be invited 
to be part of the core group within the project that ensures the project's vitality, the PMC. 
In a few projects only a subset of committers who have earned even more merit are invited to be a part of the PMC.

One thing that is sometimes hard to understand, when you are new to the open 
development process used at the ASF, is that we value the community more than 
the code. A strong and healthy community will be respectful and be a fun and 
rewarding place. More importantly, a diverse and healthy community can 
continue to support the code over the longer term, even as individual 
contributors come and go from the field.

In particular, we have some [etiquette and behavior expectations][8] when 
you work with Apache communities.

## Anyone Can Become A Committer

There is nothing at the Apache Software Foundation that says you must write code 
in order to be a committer. Anyone who is supportive by contributing towards project,
community, documentation or code is a likely candidate for committership.

Apache strives to be meritocratic. That is, once someone has contributed sufficiently 
towards the project, they can be voted in as a committer. Being a committer does not 
necessarily mean you commit code; it means you are committed to the project and are 
productively contributing to its success.

One of the key contributions people can make to the community is through the 
support of a wide user base by assisting users on the user list, writing user-oriented docs and ensuring the developers understand the user viewpoint. 
A main idea behind being a committer is the ability to be a mentor and to work 
cooperatively with your peers.

Some users of a project's software become committers in their own right. Some will test code, 
some will write documentation, some will do bug triage and some will write code.
