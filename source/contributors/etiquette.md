title: Apache Community Etiquette Guidelines
---

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and our many Apache projects welcome all 
participants who are willing to respect our community guidelines. There are 
many behavior or etiquette guides for online communities out there; we have a few 
Apache-specific tips below.

# Code of Conduct # {#coc}

The ASF has adopted a [Code of Conduct][1] which covers interactions in 
all the online spaces that Apache projects use - email, issue trackers, wikis, 
websites, IRC, and the like.  Apache projects are made up of volunteers, and 
we work to ensure that all projects welcome productive contributions.  Every 
Apache PMC is expected to ensure that their project's lists follow 
proper behavior.

# Distributed, Archived, Worldwide Online Communities # {#worldwide}

Apache projects are made up of communities of volunteers from around the 
world.  When you are sending email to an Apache project mailing list, there may 
be software developers in this country, marketing managers in that country, and 
homemakers in another country reading your email.  They will be reading at all hours of the day, at work, at home, and on the go.  If you 
want a response to your questions or suggestions, be sure to be polite and 
sensitive to your readers' circumstances when writing.

There are many amazing people helping out on Apache project email 
lists - but they are all volunteers.  Being respectful of the time and 
culture of others on the list is key to making productive contributions.

# One Member's Participation Guidelines # {#member}

The ASF as a corporation is run by several hundred Members who have deep and lasting experience 
in helping to build and run long-term, successful, open-source projects.  This is just one member's take on how to approach 
communicating in any particular Apache project.


**Some General Guidelines**

  * Assume that the other party agrees more than disagrees with you. We
tend to leave out agreements and focus on differences. When we forget our agreements, our disagreements can escalate absurdly for no rational reason.

  * When in doubt, assume that you are interpreting the message incorrectly
and ask for verification that you understood what the sender was trying to say.

  * When writing, assume that every sentence will be misinterpreted.
Review and try to reformulate to be as clear as possible.

  * Use a submissive tone in all writing. Instead of the strong "In my
opinion, we must..." or the quite neutral "I think we should...", try to
use "Maybe we should consider..." or "Another idea that we could..."

  * If you disagree strongly with an email, tag it Important, then
put it aside. Read it again half a day later. Put it aside. Read it again the
next day. After that, it will be easier to write a balanced and inviting response,
instead of delivering the initial vitriol that flows through us when we get upset. I have
found that sometimes a response won't be necessary, as the importance
was actually much lower than I originally perceived, and I can
work _with_, instead of _against_, a given change.

  * Be forgiving and accept different priorities. The other person is not
out to get you or attack your work. More often than not, it is one of the
above (a-d) that is failing, or the other person prioritizes some
aspect higher than you do. Sometimes, this requires compromises; sometimes
the different priorities can co-exist.

  * Remember that everyone works on Apache projects as a volunteer.
People have jobs and lives outside of their Apache projects, and may need 
more time to read and respond to messages on the list.  Be patient.

**Most communities at Apache consists of level-headed, reasonable people** who
have a strong, vested interest in their Apache project. This interest, often
passion, can be a source of tension, but it is also what unites
people within the community. It is easy to forget the vast amount of
agreement that exists, and get upset over relatively small disagreements.
Ability to put that aside, or downplay the importance of disagreements, will help ensure a
harmonious project.

**Face-to-Face** is excellent way to eliminate disagreements, but that is often
not practical. Consider talking things out on Skype, Google Hangout or the project's Slack channel, just for the social aspect
of being part of this community. It should not be formal, and the
invitation should go out to everyonek. Perhaps someone will want to make a short
presentation of what he/she is doing, to have some "structure", but that
might not be needed. Once we can add a face and voice to the words we read, and a general
idea how that person is socially, we are much more capable to interact by
email.

**Project decisions must always be made on email lists**.  
It's great to have a synchronous online chat to work through some questions, but 
be sure to bring the results of the chat - and any proposals for the 
project community to consider - back to the email list.  People who 
weren't able to attend the chat or call might also have ideas on the topic.
Be sure to allow at least 72 hours for others to read the proposals and 
comment before closing out the issue.
