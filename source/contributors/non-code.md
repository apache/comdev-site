While most people think of contributing *code* when they think of open
source participation, and most project contribution guides focus on
code contributions, there are many other ways to contribute to an open
source project.

# Ways to contribute

There are many broad categories of non-code contributions. This list is
not comprehensive. Indeed, whatever your passion or expertise, there is
probably a place for you to participate in some Apache project, or at
the Foundation level.

## Documentation

All software needs some level of documentation. And documentation needs
writers, as well as readers. If you are a writer, particularly one with
an eye for information organization, your contributions will be welcome
in almost any project community.

There are often easy starter contributions, such as grammatical or
spelling improvements.

Great value to the project can come from
collaborating directly with the software developers to explain features
more deeply and create examples and demos. You can work with users to
help them describe their use cases.

Working with [testers](#testing) to describe their failure scenarios
and desired new functionality is a way to accelerate innovation, and
help developers understand vague tickets.

## Translation and localization

Most documentation of Apache projects is written in English. Providing
translation and localization of these documents is a great service to a
project, and helps adoption across a broader part of the world.

Translation and localization of the user interface helps
users have a better experience with the product, and that, in turn,
speeds adoption and user feed back, and, thus, further innovation.

Start by having a conversation with the project about whether they have
a translation/localization process in place. Tell them what language(s)
you speak, and, if possible, give some examples of your work.

Projects should consult with [Infrastructure](https://infra.apache.org/)
about what translation/localization tools are available and recommended.

## Design

Most open source projects are designed by programmers. There are
opportunities for anyone with an artistic eye to improve the user
experience, both of the product itself, as well as the website, logos,
and other assorted imagery around the project ecosystem.

Designing banners for conferences, mascots, promotional materials, and
blog posts can make a project more engaging and welcoming. If the
project does not have a logo, work with the community to suggest
possible designs.

Working with the developers to improve the user interface of a product
can drive greater adoption of the product. Work with testers and
users to understand which parts of the product are harder to use or
understand.

Read through the website, and suggest places where images might make the
flow more attractive. Be sure that you use only images that you have an
appropriate license to use. For example, you can use images from
[photos.apachecon.com](https://photos.apachecon.com/) under a Creative
Commons license.

## Event support

## Community engagement

## Vendor engagement

## Marketing and promotion

## Testing

## Project management

Apache projects are not usually tied to strict release schedules,
feature sprints, and other strict planning regiments that you see in
commercial software development efforts. However, there's often value in
having someone who tracks what is being worked on, what's next on the
roadmap, and what is intended to be in upcoming releases. Having project
management skills can be a real benefit to a project that has a diverse
set of developers all working on different things. A project manager can
coordinate communication ensure that everyone is aware of priorities,
and help avoid conflicts.

If you're good at this kind of thing, come [talk with
us](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@community.apache.org) and
we'll try to help you find a good match with a community seeking those
skills. If you're a project that needs this kind of help, let us know!

# A word about AI

It can be tempting to use AI to analyze some portion of a project,
whether that's code or documentation, and then submit patches based on
what the AI says. We request that you carefully read the [ASF Generative
Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html)
before doing so. We also request that you remember that whatever the
source of your contribution, you are personally responsible for the
quality of that submission.

Many open source projects receive a huge number of AI-generated
contributions, and find that many of them are poor quality, or just
wrong. While it may be fine to use gen-ai as a starting place, **do
not** simply submit patches without first reviewing them yourself for
correctness and quality, as this will likely result in future
contributions being rejected, or even in your being blocked from further
participation.

# Recruiting and encouraging non-code participants

Projects should:

* Identify non-code contributions that are needed/wanted
* Recognize and celebrate non-code contributors. Committer status is
  *NOT* just for coders!
* Consider giving specific titles to leaders in non-code areas. For
  example, identify (by name) your documentation team. Identify (by
  name) your community leadership team. Identify (by name) your social
  media coordinator.
