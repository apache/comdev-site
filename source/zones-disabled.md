## community.zones.a.o has been disabled

We used to have a few apps meant to help find speakers and mentors
on the community.zones.apache.org server , but those have been disabled
in Feburary 2024 as they were not enthusiastically maintained.

The pages tagged with
[speakers](/tags/speakers.html)
or
[mentors](/tags/mentors.html)
should provide the information that used to be there.
