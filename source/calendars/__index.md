title: Apache Related Event Calendars
slug: index
---

This calendar lists major events relating to The Apache Software Foundation
and our many Apache projects.  We also have an automated
[listing of upcoming Apache-related Meetups][5] (smaller events) available.

Apache Community Development (ComDev) volunteers maintain this calendar. To have your event considered for inclusion, email details to [dev@community.apache.org][1].
We list events that <b>already</b> conform
to the [Third Party Event Branding Policy][2] and have been approved by
the relevant Apache PMC or the Branding Committee.

<em>Disclaimer: Events called 'ApacheCon' or 'Apache Roadshow' are
official Apache Software Foundation events. Apache projects or third-party producers put on other listed events; we list them here to support
our community, but they are not official Foundation events.</em>

## Other Related Events

In addition to major conferences that have applied for approval with us, there is a wide range of other
events which feature Apache projects and technologies. A list of upcoming
[Apache related Meetups is available][5], powered in part by [this script][6]
(patches welcome!). Second, a crowd-sourced list of related events is maintained
as a [Lanyrd Guide][4], and we encourage people to help list
Apache-project-related events there.
