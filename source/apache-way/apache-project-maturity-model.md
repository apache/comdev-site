title: A Maturity Model for Apache Projects
tags: ["governance","maturity","incubator"]
---

The **Apache Project Maturity Model** provides a suggested framework for evaluating the overall maturity of an Apache project community and the codebase that it maintains.  While this model is specific to projects of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), many of these factors apply to any open source project.

# Overview

The goals of this maturity model are to describe how Apache projects operate in a concise and high-level way, and to provide a basic framework that projects may choose to use to evaluate themselves.

It is usable outside of the ASF as well, for projects that might want to adopt some or all of these principles. Projects that envision moving to the ASF at some point might start working towards this to prepare for their move.

It does not describe all the details of how our projects operate, but aims to capture the invariants of Apache projects and point to additional information where needed. To be as concise as possible we use footnotes for anything that's not part of the core model.

Contrary to other maturity models, we do not define staged partial compliance levels. A mature Apache project complies with all the elements of this model, and other projects are welcome to adopt the elements that suit their goals.

Note that we try to avoid using the word "must" below. The model describes the state of a mature project, as opposed to a set of rules.

Projects which incubate at the ASF might not fit into all the parts of this model; however a major goal of incubation is to bring the project's community closer to it.

We welcome questions and feedback about this model on the <a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@community.apache.org" target="_blank">comdev mailing list</a>.

# How To Use The Apache Project Maturity Model

**Remember:** This model is a guide; it is not a requirements document. The model shows what generally good behaviors in an Apache project look like.

So far, inside the ASF, podlings preparing their graduation
from the [Apache Incubator](https://incubator.apache.org) have used this model, mostly for self-assessment.

It might be useful for top-level ASF projects to regularly assess their maturity based on this model, but this is not a requirement at this time.

Here are a few self-assessment examples:

* [Apache OpenDAL Maturity Model Assessment, 2024](https://opendal.apache.org/community/maturity)
* [Apache ServiceComb Maturity Model Assessment, 2018](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SERVICECOMB/Apache+Maturity+Model+Assessment+for+ServiceComb)
* [Apache CarbonData Podling Maturity Assessment, 2017](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CARBONDATA/Apache+Maturity+Model+Assessment+for+CarbonData)
* [Apache Taverna Graduation Maturity Assessment, 2016](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TAVERNADEV/2016-03+Taverna+Graduation+Maturity+Assessment)
* [Apache Groovy podling self-assessment, 2015](https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/576b3c5d6a7022ac4a8df1ef118666456ce627fb/MATURITY.adoc)

Apache projects can just point to <a class="http" href="https://www.apache.org/security/">https://www.apache.org/security/</a> or use their own security contacts page, which should also point to that.

Each Apache project has a private mailing list that its PMC is expected to use
only when really needed. The private list is typically used for
discussions about people, for example to discuss and to vote on PMC
and committer candidates.

Independence can be understood as basing the project's decisions on the open
discussions that happen on the project's main communications channel,
with no hidden agendas.

See also https://apache.org/foundation/marks/reporting.html#pmcs for
more information on reporting misuses.

TB40 is a balancing act: we hope that PMCs are spending some
time responding to any obvious or blatant misuses of their brand.
But PMCs sometimes can't handle all the details of actually stopping a
potential infringement; what we really need is for PMCs to actively
report them, and then promptly respond if Brand Managment (or other
officers) ask for information when addressing a misuse.
