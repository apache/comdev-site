# Mentoring a new PMC member

So I'm a PMC member now. What does this mean? What rights do I have now
that I didn't have before? What conversations belong on the private
list, as opposed to the public list.

These things vary a little from one project to another, so clearly
documenting them for your particular project is critical. And
specifically assigning a PMC mentor to new PMC members can greatly help
that new member get up to speed, and prevent problems in the future.

Here's the basic things that a new PMC member needs to know, and how you
can help them in their new job.

Outline:

* The PMC chair is not the project lead
* Any PMC member can nominate committers, PMC members
* Reporting
* Responding to the Board
* A word about vendor neutrality
