# Mentoring: First Patch

A beginner's first patch on a project can be an intimidating and
frustrating experience. Clearly documenting the entire process from
checkout to accepted patch greatly lowers the barrier for a new
contributor, and makes it more likely that they'll come back for their
second patch.

Here's some tips on how to do that.

Outline:

* Talk to the project first
    * Make sure it's wanted/welcome
    * See if there's already work in progress, or suggestions
    * Find someone to be your advocate
* Finding the source
* Writing a good commit message
* Following up on your pull request
* Learning from your struggle: Improving the documentation
