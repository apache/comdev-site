# Mentoring

A major job of Community Development is mentoring. Mentoring is the
process of actively bringing someone along in a discipline - investing
your time into influencing the future. Time spent mentoring today will
pay off for years to come.

Anyone can be a mentor. You just have to take a moment to encourage
someone else to participate.

Here's some concrete ways you can provide mentoring to other members of
your community.
