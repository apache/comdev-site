Google is sponsoring the [2021 Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and 
[The Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) (ASF) will soon be registered as a mentoring organization.
This page is your entry point to the ASF GSoC program.
Please watch this page for updates concerning our participation in GSoC 2021.

# Students: read this

* Learn [about GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/about/).
* Decide if you are [eligible](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/) for GSoC.
* Review [Advice for Students](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2011/03/dos-and-donts-of-google-summer-of-code.html)
 to make sure you really want to apply to GSoC.
* Watch [GSoC video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IP_6HG2QE)
 for students.
* Examine the list of [available ASF GSoC 2021 projects](https://s.apache.org/gsoc2021ideas).
	* <span class="text-primary">**NOTE**</span> that you can search the issue tracker for GSoC projects by
filtering using the "*gsoc2021*" label to narrow down the list to the projects you are interested in.<br/>
Or use this link https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=labels+%3D+gsoc2021
* If you do not see any interesting projects from the proposed ideas, we encourage you to contact one an Apache Project that interests you (email the `dev@` mailing list for the project) and propose a project idea. The project community will review the proposal. The ASF does not encourage and will not respond to your personal open source project ideas which are unrelated to any Apache projects.
* Please NOTE that `Ideas list` requires a manual update. Ping `mentors (at) community.apache.org` if your idea does not appear in within a reasonable time.

### Applying for GSoC

Details are available now and we are in the project discussion phase. We encourage you to discuss your application with the community of the project that interests you.

To apply, please provide

* a list of deliverables, quantifiable results for the Apache community.
* a detailed description / design document.
* an approach.
* an approximate schedule.
* some background about yourself, the proposal in general, and how it relates to one or more Apache projects.

We also need you to let us know what other commitments you
have for the period of GSoC. For example, do you have any exams or a part
time job that would limit your availability? In other words - sell yourself, as if this was an actual job. 

In drawing up your proposal you should work with your chosen project's
community.

One of our evaluation criteria is that you have already engaged
with the community to ensure that you understand the needs of the project
and the commitment you need to make to your mentors.

Once the application period starts, submit your application through the [GSoC site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

### Application template

_This is just a suggested template, feel free to add and remove sections as appropriate. Be brief, don't write a large essay!_

#### About me

_What relevant experience you have, including university studies, work and hobby activities._

#### Background

_What exists already? What is the identified need? What can you reuse, what needs to he replaced?_

_Example: Apache Foo has already got support for HTTP client requests, but this does not work well with OAuth-based services. The main interface for requests can be reused, but this project proposes to replace the backend code with a modular approach based on Apache Bar._

#### Design / description of work

_Brief list of things you will do / create, in some rough chronological order._

_Show which bits are essential, and which are optional. Highlight what is new, what are modifications, and how your work fits into the existing architecture._

_Example:_

* _Investigate REST client libraries_
* _Develop JavaScript functions for browsing files (optional)_
* _Integrate with Apache Foo's request system (essential)_


#### Results for the Apache community

_Benefit of your work to Apache $Project users and developers. What will be the legacy of your work after you finish?_

#### Deliverables

_Include milestones, components, documentation, tests._

#### Scheduling

_Not too detailed, but some milestones and checkpoints. Rough estimates per work item (weeks/days). Remember to leave time for slack and bugfixing!_

#### Other commitments

_Exams, part time work, holidays, lectures._

#### Community engagement

_In particular with Apache $Project, including project mailing lists, wikis, issue trackers, test systems._

_This should show a rough understanding of working with open source communities. You should be engaged with the rest of the community both before coding starts (e.g. to develop this proposal) and during the project._

_Include any planned user testing, prototypes, code review._

## Contacting the ASF

The ASF is not just one project, it is a federation of projects; see the
lists at [https://www.apache.org/](https://www.apache.org) and [https://incubator.apache.org/](https://incubator.apache.org/). Each project has its own community of users, contributors and committers. GSoC
students usually interact with just one of these communities. 

Each of the proposed subjects (link to be provided if we are confirmed as a
mentoring organisation) applies to a single ASF project. You will need to
engage with that project community.

# Prospective ASF mentors: read this

We are looking for as many interesting projects as we can come up with. For
more info about mentoring, please read our [guide to being a mentor](guide-to-being-a-mentor.html)
.

Prospective mentors must join the mentors@community.apache.org mailing list,
this is where mentor specific-issues are dealt with, and where
announcements appear. If you want to track program
administration, subscribe to dev@community.apache.org.

Once the ASF is confirmed as a mentoring organisation, mentors must register
with the GSoC webapp, and request to become a mentor for the ASF
organization. Make sure that the email address you use for that (it's often
your @gmail.com address by default) is '''registered as a mail alias for your Apache account at (https://id.apache.org)''' so that we can match it to your ASF account.

We invite all ASF projects to submit their ideas to their issue tracker. Be sure to add the labels "*gsoc2021*" and "*mentor*" so that we can
automatically include the submissions in our list of subjects. If your project does
not use JIRA please contact dev@community.apache.org.

# Organization Vouching

The ASF currently has no policy establishing the criteria for vouching for another organization. Until one is established the ASF therefore doesn't vouch for any organization.
