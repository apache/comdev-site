title: Pilot Mentoring Programme with India ICFOSS
---

> Note that this information is about a pilot program that
> happened back in 2013.

The ASF has been participating in many mentoring initiatives, and it's now
partnering in a pilot project with India ICFOSS to provide mentoring for
undergraduate and graduate students that have interest in learning how
to participate in open source communities at ASF.

The mentoring programme is not here to teach you to write documentation or
code. It is here to help you understand how to make a valuable contribution
to an Apache project. You can expect to be guided through our contribution
processes. You can also expect to get technical support with respect to
your chosen project. You cannot expect your mentor to be a "teacher", they
will provide enough information for you to progress within the project. You
need to bring the confidence to take their guidance and discover the detail
for yourself.

## Applying for the Mentor Programme

Students can propose their own project ideas, or select one from the ASF provided list. After selecting the project ideas. students should create a project proposal following guidance from the **mentor** and the **project community**.

The project proposal should have, at minimum :

+ **WHAT** Detailed description of the what is being implemented as part of the project.
+ **HOW** How the project is going to be implemented. Here you would describe your approach towards solving the problem, as well as technical details (which shows to the mentor that you have a clear idea of what needs to be implemented). High level system design diagrams is a plus.
+ **WHEN** A detailed schedule of what tasks you are going to implement by when.

See the proposals examples below as guidance:

+ [Searching artifact across SCA Domains](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TUSCANYWIKI/Searching+artifacts+across+SCA+domain)
+ [GIMPLE to GRAPHITE transformation](http://students.fim.uni-passau.de/~grosser/gcc_soc/)
+ [Nmap Scripting Engine â€“ Infrastructure Manager](http://opendz.org/users/tixxdz/gsoc/gsoc_2010_proposal_nmap_scripting_engine_short_version.pdf)

Note that the proposals below are just examples from previous GSoC programs, and each one have different strengths. But you should always follow your mentors advice, as he is the one that is going to be judging your proposals.
