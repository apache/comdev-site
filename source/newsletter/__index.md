# Community Development Newsletter

The Community Development project has started a monthly newsletter, to
keep the larger Apache Community informed of what's happening across the
Foundation. If you would like to contribute content to this newsletter,
please join the [ComDev mailing
list](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@community.apache.org)
where this message is drafted.
