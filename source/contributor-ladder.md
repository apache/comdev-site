Projects at the ASF offer a way to grow in your responsibilities in the
project, from being a user, all the way up to being a maintainer of the
project. While the specific details may look different from one project
to another, the rungs of the ladder look mostly the same.

{{% toc %}}

## User

Everything that we do in an ASF project is for the user. As a user of an
Apache project, your responsibilities are just to enjoy the software.

We encourage you to join the user mailing list to ask questions, and
make suggestions. Members of the project are there to help out when you
run into problems. You can find this list (or lists) by looking under the
project name on [lists.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org).

As a user, you're expected to abide by the project's [code of
conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct), so that
interactions are polite, friendly, and helpful.

As you become a power user of the project, you may consider becoming a
contributor.

## Contributor

While most people think of open source contributors as being coders,
there are a wider variety of ways that you can contribute to a project.

Most users' first contribution will be to open a ticket on the project's
issue tracker, or to answer a less experienced user's questions. These
actions help shape the future direction of the project, and are
important contributions.

We encourage you to join the project's developer mailing list at this
time, to engage with the discussions about the direction that the project
is taking. You can find this list (or lists) by looking under the
project name on [lists.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org).

Other contributions may include design, promotion, documentation
improvements, events, and many other things.

[See more about being a contributor](/contributors/).

As you become more involved with contributing to the project, you may
want to work towards [becoming a
committer](/contributors/becomingacommitter.html).

## Committer

After making a number of contributions to a project, its PMC may invite you
to become a committer. Note that the criteria for inviting a contributor
to become a committer will vary greatly from one project to another.

Once you have been invited to become a committer, and have accepted this
invitation, you are authorized to commit changes directly to the
project's source code repository. Note, however, that different projects
may have different social norms around committing changes.

Broadly referred to as CTR (Commit Then Review) and RTC (Review Then
Commit), the exact mechanisms may vary. For example, you may be
authorized to commit documentation changes without approval, while code
changes may be submitted as a pull request, for other committers to
review and approve before they are merged.

[See more information about being a committer](/committers/).

## PMC Member

After being a committer for some time, the project's PMC may invite you to become a member
of the project's Project Management Committee. This group acts as the
steering committee for the project, making decisions about the project's
road map, what features will be added, and other decisions around the
project.

The PMC *should* be conducting all of these conversations on the public
developer mailing list(s), in the view of the entire community. A PMC
also has a private mailing list, which is for discussion of topics such
as the addition of new committers and PMC members, and any other
sensitive topics.
[See more information about being a PMC member](/pmc/).

### Terminology: PMC and PMC Member

Note that the term _PMC_ refers to the _group_ that steers a project.

The _people_ who are members of the group are called _PMC Members_.

Referring to those people as _PMCs_ is incorrect and can be confusing,
please avoid doing that.

## Foundation Member

When someone has been involved at the ASF for a while, they may be
invited, by the membership, to become a member of the Foundation. This entitles them to vote
for the Board of Directors, to participate in the members' mailing list,
and to invite others to become Foundation members.

[See more about being a Foundation 
member](https://apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html)

## Officers of the Foundation

Officers of the Foundation are responsible for various aspects of the
day-to-day operation of the Foundation. You can see how these roles are
broken down in the [Foundation organization
chart](https://whimsy.apache.org/foundation/orgchart/board).

## Board of Directors

The members of the ASF elect the members of the Board annually for 
one-year terms.

The Board of Directors is responsible for the governance of the
Foundation. This includes overseeing projects, to ensure they are
behaving in accordance with ASF policies and norms.

The Board also delegates much of the day-to-day operation of the
Foundation to the President, and various officers and committees.

You can see the current composition of the Board on the [Board
website](https://apache.org/foundation/board/).
