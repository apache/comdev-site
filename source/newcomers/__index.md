In this section we'll help you take your first steps as an open source 
developer in one of our many Apache project communities. As an all-volunteer 
run organization, Apache and the many Apache projects rely on people like 
you stepping up to help out.  

  * [Where do I start?](/gettingStarted/101.html) - a guide to your first engagement with an Apache project
  * [How should I behave?](/contributors/etiquette) - etiquette and codes of conduct at Apache
  * [Newbie FAQ](/newbiefaq.html) - some commonly asked questions (and their answers)
  * [How many projects are at Apache?](https://projects.apache.org/) - we have a **LOT** of different project communities!
  * [Just show me the code!](https://www.apache.org/dev/) - site index of technical questions (where's SVN, how to log in, etc.)

*The more you give the more you get out*. 

It's natural to assume that, as a newcomer, 
you have little to offer the ASF. However, you will be surprised at
how much you can help, even now. 

Since we aim to be a place for newcomers to learn
about the ASF as a whole and you are (probably) a newcomer, *any feedback
you can give or unanswered questions you can ask us here* will help us improve what
we offer to those who come after you. Our [etiquette tips](/contributors/etiquette) can help you 
write emails that will get some answers.

You can provide feedback on this website and ask questions about anything Apache by subscribing to our mailing
list. Send an email to 
[dev-subscribe@community.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@community.apache.org). Once subscribed you can send your questions or feedback to
[dev@community.apache.org](mailto:dev@community.apache.org).
