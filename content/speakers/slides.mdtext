This page contains links to presentations about the ASF and how 
Apache projects work that you may find useful.  Many of these have 
been presented at [ApacheCon conferences](http://events.apache.org) or 
other open source conferences in the past.

These presentations are available under permissive licenses; please see
each individual presentation for license details.  More tips and links for 
[speakers are available](http://community.apache.org/speakers/index.html).

Similarly, many Apache speakers post their slides to the <a href="//www.slideshare.net/search/slideshow?searchfrom=header&q=apache+software">SlideShare website</a>,
and the [FeatherCast podcast offers audio recordings](//feathercast.apache.org/) of many talks and interviews.

For those who prefer videos, our many volunteers have posted 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheApacheFoundation/playlists">full videos of all ApacheCon NA 2013 presentations</a>, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU2OcwpQkYCzvGxZgVOunTs-3iEao6YJc">select ApacheCon NA 2014 presentations</a>.
Additional slides, videos and audio recordings can also be found from the 
<a href="https://wiki.apache.org/apachecon/Past_Conference_Resources">ApacheCon Past Conference Resources page</a>.
