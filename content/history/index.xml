      <description>Note that this information is about a pilot program that happened back in 2013.
The ASF has been participating in many mentoring initiatives, and it&amp;rsquo;s now partnering in a pilot project with India ICFOSS to provide mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students that have interest in learning how to participate in open source communities at ASF.
The mentoring programme is not here to teach you to write documentation or code.</description>
