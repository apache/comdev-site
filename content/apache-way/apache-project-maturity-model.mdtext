Title: A Maturity Model for Apache Projects

The **Apache Project Maturity Model** provides a suggested framework for evaluating the overall maturity of an Apache project community and the codebase that it maintains.  While this model is specific to Apache projects (i.e. hosted at the ASF) many of these factors are important for any open source project.

# Overview

The goal of this maturity model is to describe how Apache projects operate, in a concise and high-level way, and to provide a basic framework that projects may choose to use to evaluate themselves.

It is meant to be usable outside of Apache as well, for projects that might want to adopt some or all of these principles. Projects that envision moving to Apache at some point might start working towards this to prepare for their move.

It does not describe all the details of how our projects operate, but aims to capture the invariants of Apache projects and point to additional information where needed. To keep the main model as concise as possible we use footnotes for anything that's not part of the core model.

Contrary to other maturity models, we do not define staged partial compliance levels. A mature Apache project complies with all the elements of this model, and other projects are welcome to pick and choose the elements that suit their goals.

Note that we try to avoid using the word "must" below. The model describes the state of a mature project, as opposed to a set of rules. Newer projects in the Incubator might not fit into all the parts of this model; however part of the process of Incubation should tend to move their community behavior to fit the model.

Questions and feedback about this model are welcome on the <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/community-dev/">comdev mailing list</a>.

# How To Use The Apache Project Maturity Model

See the <a href="https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/576b3c5d6a7022ac4a8df1ef118666456ce627fb/MATURITY.adoc">Groovy podling 2015 self-assessment</a> for an example of how to use this
model to prepare a graduation from the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">Apache Incubator</a>.

**Remember:** This model is a suggested guide; it is not a requirements document.  The model shows what generally good behaviors in an Apache project look like.

## Other Open Source Project Models

See <a href="http://s.apache.org/apache_maturity_model">http://s.apache.org/apache_maturity_model</a> for the discussions that led to this. And thanks to the many people who provided input! The links below are both inspirations for our model above, and are some of the other ways that FOSS project participants have tried to quantify ways to measure open source projects.

It's ok for platforms (like a runtime used to execute our code) to have  different licenses as long as they don't impose reciprocal licensing on 
what we are distributing.

In Apache projects, the ASF owns the copyright for the collective work, 
i.e. the project's releases. Contributors retain copyright on their 
contributions but grant the ASF a perpetual copyright license for them.

 The required level of security depends on the software's intended uses, of course. Expectations should be clearly documented.

 Apache projects can just point to <a class="http" href="http://www.apache.org/security/">http://www.apache.org/security/</a> or use their own security contacts page, which should also point to that.

 In Apache projects, "consensus" means <em>widespread agreement among people who have decision power</em>. It does not necessarily mean "unanimity".

Apache projects have a private mailing list that their PMC is expected to use 
only when really needed. The private list is typically used for 
discussions about people, for example to discuss and to vote on PMC 
candidates privately.

Independence can be understood as basing the project's decisions on the open 
discussions that happen on the project's main communications channel, 
with no hidden agendas.
