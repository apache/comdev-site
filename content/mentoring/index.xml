      <description>Mentoring a new committer &amp;para; So I&amp;rsquo;m a committer now. What&amp;rsquo;s next? What rights do I have now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have before? What are the social conventions around making a commit?
These things vary from one project to another, so clearly documenting them for your particular project is critical.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the basics that are true across (almost) all Apache projects.

      <description>Mentoring a new PMC member &amp;para; So I&amp;rsquo;m a PMC member now. What does this mean? What rights do I have now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have before? What conversations belong on the private list, as opposed to the public list.
These things vary a little from one project to another, so clearly documenting them for your particular project is critical. And specifically assigning a PMC mentor to new PMC members can greatly help that new member get up to speed, and prevent problems in the future.</description>

      <description>Mentoring Mentors &amp;para; The job of a mentor is to reproduce - spread the work load. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve mentored someone, you need to encourage them to become a mentor themselves. Here&amp;rsquo;s some ways you can do that.
Point out people that need a little help Encourage them to answer a question rather than answering it yourself &amp;hellip; TODO</description>

      <title>Mentoring: First Patch</title>

      <description>Mentoring: First Patch &amp;para; A beginner&amp;rsquo;s first patch on a project can be an intimidating and frustrating experience. Clearly documenting the entire process from checkout to accepted patch greatly lowers the barrier for a new contributor, and makes it more likely that they&amp;rsquo;ll come back for their second patch.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some tips on how to do that.
Outline:
Talk to the project first Make sure it&amp;rsquo;s wanted/welcome See if there&amp;rsquo;s already work in progress, or suggestions Find someone to be your advocate Finding the source Writing a good commit message Following up on your pull request Learning from your struggle: Improving the documentation </description>
