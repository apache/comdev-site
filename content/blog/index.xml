      <description>“I was able to make my first contribution yesterday, and today it was merged. I&amp;rsquo;m so excited about my first steps in open source&amp;quot;, a participant said about the First Summit for Open Source Contributors, which took place this September in Guadalajara, México. How do you involve others in open source? How can we make this space more inclusive for groups with low representation in the field?
With these questions in mind and the call to contribute to software that is powering the world&amp;rsquo;s favorite products, the Apache Software Foundation, along with the CNCF, sponsored the First Summit for Open Source Contributors in Mexico.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of magic happening in the IoT sector at the moment. A lot of new projects are appearing and older projects are growing and extending their functionality. We have noticed that it&amp;rsquo;s currently quite difficult to keep track who the players in this field are and what they&amp;rsquo;re up to. So we decided to create a new mailing-list to help improve the communication:
iot@apache.org (Archive at: https://lists.apache.org/list.html?iot@apache.org)
We hope this communication-channel will help reduce unnecessary double-work and improve streamlining the projects to work together as good a possible.</description>

      <description>Apache Beam has been a top-level project since January 2017. I, current Beam PMC Chair, would like to share some of Beam&amp;rsquo;s recent efforts to tackle the challenges of growing our community.
[Updated Feb 27, 2019 to clarify that the article is authored by the Beam PMC Chair and describes the Beam project&amp;rsquo;s work to build their own community. Previously it could have mistakenly been read as an ASF Foundation statement about the Beam project, or as describing an ASF action taken upon the Beam project.</description>

Google Summer of Code is a program where students work on open source projects backed by a stipend granted by Google. The Apache Software Foundation has been participating in the program since its inception in 2005.
Each year, 30-40 students are guided by volunteer mentors from various Apache communities. During the summer they learn what it means to participate in a diverse open source community and develop open source software &amp;ldquo;The Apache Way&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This is historical content, not relevant anymore but kept here as an archive.Who should host their projects on Apache Extras?
Apache Extras is aimed primarily those who are unable or unwilling to licence their code under the Apache License V2, but want to signal their relationship to one or more Apache project community.
One example of this is my own Drupal connector for Apache Wookie (Incubating). This needs to be GPL licensed due to the Drupal dependency, but it contains Apache Licensed code as well.</description>

      <title>Why Apache Extras?</title>

      <description>This is historical content, not relevant anymore but kept here as an archive.All Apache projects use the same pragmatic software license, the Apache License v2. However, we recognise that there are other FOSS licences out there, some of which are incompatible with the Apache License v2.
Code under these licenses cannot be hosted on Apache servers, but people sometimes choose to, or are required to, use them.
Until the launch of apache-extras these projects had no a single home to go to.</description>

      <description>The Apache Software Foundation exists to provide legal and technological infrastructure for open source projects. By and large, the Foundation leaves the individual project communities to make their own choices about their development process. There are some constraints that result from the fundamental legal umbrella held by the Foundation. For the Foundation to protect contributors, projects must respect the rules regarding IP management and releases. A more interesting set of constraints, however, stems from the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s commitment to Open Source software development as a communal process.</description>

      <description>Sharing a code repository with some other programmers might seem enough to create an open source project; the Apache Software Foundation goes further and focuses on making projects sustainable in the long term, and ensuring that our code is legally clean.
This means that our projects have to follow a (small) number of rules, and a number of best practices have been established over the years.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick description of how Apache projects are born and live on - some of the items below are derived from the ASF&amp;rsquo;s bylaws (http://www.</description>
