		<h2>My First Experience Of ApacheCon by Stephen Downie</h2>
		<span class="published-info">Published on Thursday, May 25, 2017

	<br><br>
	<p>Let me start with a small introduction of myself. My name is Stephen Downie and I have been working in the world of IT
for only 2 months. Tom Barber, an ASF member and committer, recently got in touch and offered me the opportunity to
retrain. I have previously worked for the last 20 years in retail and if I&rsquo;m being honest hated 90% of my time at work,
so I thought why not. I knew Tom was very knowledgeable and I had always been very envious of his Facebook posts, it
seemed like every week he was working on a new project in different countries all over the world from India to Europe to
the US. As part of the offer he said he would like to take me to Miami to a conference called ApacheCon….How could I say
no? I had never heard of ApacheCon prior to this and in my naivety assumed it was something to do with helicopters (like
I said I have zero experience in IT). The weeks passed and Tom was sending more and more documentation through, the
thoughts that I was massively out of my depth started growing.</p>
<p>Anyway, 13th May arrived and our flight was leaving the UK at 10:20am so we set off to the airport. Excited, nervous,
anxious were just a few of the emotions I was experiencing at this stage. Check in went smoothly and we were off. We
landed mid afternoon Miami time and made our way to the apartment. To make the most of our time away Tom had booked
tickets for us to see a baseball game (I guess it&rsquo;s a must when in the States), we went to the beach and explored Miami.
My new life/career in IT had started and it was amazing, but work had yet to start….What would it be like?</p>
<p>Tuesday 16th arrived and alarms were set early. We drove to the Intercontinental Hotel, the venue
for <a href="http://apachecon.com/">ApacheCon 2017</a>. The building was huge and I felt very out of place walking through the
large automatic doors and stepping on to the escalators. As we approached the first floor I was suddenly at
work. <a href="http://sched.co/AghA">Tom was doing a talk on OODT</a> so had to join a different line for registration so I was,
for the first time on my own. I joined the back of the line and slowly edged forwards. I was listening to the
conversation, it all sounded very foreign to me but what did strike me was that people of all nationalities all seemed
to be old friends. Closer to the front on the line I edged. I registered and received my badge and a free t-shirt (very
nice it was too). I wandered around looking for Tom who was already chatting to a group of people so I took it upon
myself to have a chat to some people at the sponsor stands and get myself some swag. It all seemed very interesting but
mostly went over my head. The thing that was striking me was everyone seemed so friendly and welcoming (very different
from the career I had come from where no one seemed to have time for anyone other than themselves).</p>
<p>The previous evening we had gone through the schedule planner and made an itinerary for me of talks that would be
interesting/useful to attend. I would start my day in the Versailles Ballroom to watch the opening Keynotes. Again it
struck me that so many people knew each other and were catching up on what had been a year since they last met. The
speakers were great and had really got me in the mood for what was to come. I have to
mention <a href="https://youtu.be/hFqGg8a6JHo?list=PLbzoR-pLrL6pLDCyPxByWQwYTL-JrF5Rp">Sandra Matz&rsquo;s talk on Digital Psychometrics and the Future Effect on Technology</a>
. She was both captivating and funny and also the British accent helped me feel at home. The Apply Magic Sauce app was
very interesting, it reckons I&rsquo;m 31&hellip; who doesn&rsquo;t want a few years knocked off their age? It was then a coffee break. I
had only been there a few hours and already there was free nibbles and drinks. I grabbed a meat patty and a bottle of
Orange and then went to the Alhambra Room to check that Tom was set up for his
talk, <a href="http://sched.co/AghA">OODT 2.0: The Future of Distributed Data Management</a>. The room wasn&rsquo;t packed but a good
15-20 people turned up and listened to Tom talk about the use of OODT with his work at NASA. I listened and tried to
make sense of it but once again it was slightly over my head. After Tom had finished we split up and I was attending a
talk on my own (scared!!) I made my way to Biscayne Room to watch Peyman Mohajerian give a talk
on <a href="http://sched.co/AiqG">Continuous Applications with Apache Spark 2.0.</a> I got my notebook out and tried to make notes
of the bits I thought were useful but also so I could quiz Tom about them later. I noticed a lot of people taking photos
of the slides so I got involved and did the same (was I getting the hang of it?) The talk was interesting from what I
could take from it but once again I&rsquo;m not sure I really understood what was going on (there seems to be an occurring
theme here).</p>
<p>It was lunch, I needed to eat, my brain felt overloaded with so much information so we headed out and found a restaurant
to eat at. In case you were wondering I ate calamari for the first time, it was lovely (a week of firsts continuing).
When we returned to the venue, next up for me
was <a href="https://s.apache.org/buM2">Leveraging Docker for Hadoop Build Automation and Big Data Stack Provisioning with Evan Ye</a>
in the Balmoral Room. For the first time during this talk I could relate to some of what he was talking about as Tom has
introduced me to these bits of software with Spicule, the company I&rsquo;m now working for. It was quite high level and I
soon got lost but it felt good. After the talk I went to find Tom as I wanted to ask him some questions about what I had
just heard. I found him in the corridor. He asked how my first day was going, I didn&rsquo;t really know other than my mind
felt like it was melting but I had something I could actually ask him and he had the answers!!  I was then supposed to
be going back to the Alhambra room for a talk on comparison of <a href="http://sched.co/A02I">Spark SQL with Hive</a>.</p>
<p>Later Tom suggested I went with him to the Brickell Room which was part of ApacheCon (everything I had attended was the
Big Data side of it so far)
. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-zKn4MlUi4?list=PLbzoR-pLrL6pLDCyPxByWQwYTL-JrF5Rp">Bob Paulin was giving a talk on user groups</a> (
something I had attended in my short time in IT) The way he spoke and engaged the attendees was amazing and something I
could relate too as I enjoy public speaking and engaging an audience. After the talk he came and sat at the table with
myself and Tom. I thanked him for delivering a talk that I could relate to. Tom explained that I had zero experience of
Apache and IT in general. I told him what talks I had attended so far and he laughed and said “So he&rsquo;s thrown you into
the deep end then”. I don&rsquo;t know if he realised but that is when my experience changed as I then realised that I was
never likely to have understood much of what I had heard (Tom later explained he didn&rsquo;t expect me to but that the main
reason I was here was to get a better understanding of the environment as a whole). The day finished with
the <a href="https://youtu.be/-vqcGDltQLo?list=PLbzoR-pLrL6pLDCyPxByWQwYTL-JrF5Rp">Podling Shark Tank</a> which was a fun way to
bring the day to an end. I thought then it was home time but before that we had beer to drink and food to eat and people
to chat to. The thing I took from my first day was there was a varying level of expertise and knowledge but that the one
thing everyone had in common was their love for Apache software. When I got back to the apartment I was shattered,
opened a beer and fell asleep on the sofa!</p>
<p>Day 2 went pretty much the same way, a lot of techie talks and then coffee then more techie talks and then food but it
was when I attended the talk in Brickell Room
with <a href="https://youtu.be/vT-kxmoLs5k?list=PLbzoR-pLrL6pLDCyPxByWQwYTL-JrF5Rp">Sharan Foga on Committed to The Apache Way</a>,
that things started to make a lot of sense to me. As the week had gone on I was feeling like a bit of an intruder in the
midst of all these IT geniuses with their talk about coding and programming but as Sharan started I realised that the
ASF was so much more than this and that one of their most important sayings was it&rsquo;s about “Community over Code”. This
helped everything make sense and finally I could see that I could have a place within the Apache Foundation. Her talk
was so enlightening to me, that evening Tom and I spent hours talking about the ASF and not just technology, about what
it takes to be a committer, how to gain the trust and other ways to be involved with the foundation (perhaps I had found
my place?).</p>
<p>Day 3 seemed very sedate compared to the first two days as a lot of people had left early for flights. We attended a few
interesting talks throughout the day and spent time recapping what my experience had been like. My head was fried and
I&rsquo;m sure i didn&rsquo;t make a great deal of sense which is why I wanted to write this blog to try and get my thoughts and
experiences out there in the hope that it may inspire other people to get involved too. In the last talk we attended
with <a href="https://youtu.be/vRPTPMwI53k?list=PLbzoR-pLrL6pLDCyPxByWQwYTL-JrF5Rp">Tim Allison on Evaluating Text Extraction: Apache Tika&rsquo;s New Tika-Eval Module</a>
Tom thought it would be a good idea to volunteer me to write a UI for the software which is something I will certainly
be keen to try (maybe I would be a coder after all).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to say a massive thanks to all that were involved in make ApacheCon 2017 an amazing event and I hope that I
will be able to attend the next one. Thanks!</p>
