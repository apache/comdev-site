	<p>Welcome to our monthly blog update about what is happening in Apache Community Development (ComDev)!</p>
<p>This month we have news about attending the FOSS Backstage Micro Summit, we share some interviews from the Prague Open
Source Summit, we revitalise our Jira issue tracker, we welcome a new PMC Chair, we translate our ASF brochure into more
languages, we prepare for FOSDEM and a for a half day track at the Open Source Summit in Paris, and we look at
introducing Apache Community Business Cards.</p>
<h3 id="foss-backstage-micro-summit">FOSS Backstage Micro Summit <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#foss-backstage-micro-summit">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The schedule for FOSS Backstage Micro Summit, which takes place in Berlin on November 20th, has been announced and
focuses on community, governance and the legal aspects around open source. Several speakers from Apache have been
selected to present. Full details of the program can be found at the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/news/foss-backstage-micro-summit-program-online-now">FOSS Backstage Program</a></p>

<h3 id="open-source-summit-europe">Open Source Summit Europe <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#open-source-summit-europe">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It was great to meet people and talk about Apache and other related topics at the Open Source Summit in Prague in
October. Although we did not have a booth at this event, there were several Apache related presentations including a
keynote from Neha Narkhede about Apache Kafka,</p>
<p>Other talks included Rich Bowen&rsquo;s presentation about why mentoring is so important, Piergiorgio Lucidi&rsquo;s talk on the
incubation process for Apache ManifoldCF and Sharan Foga&rsquo;s presentation of the ASF Committer Diversity Survey at the
Diversity Empowerment Summit.</p>
<p>We also managed to record some interviews for our podcast channel FeatherCast and you can find details of the interviews
below</p>
<ul>
<li>Interview with Robert Kratky about Documentation (Feature Based vs User Stories)</li>
<li><a href="https://feathercast.apache.org/2017/10/30/oss-prague-apache-manifoldcf-and-incubation-piergiorgio-lucidi/">Interview with Piergiorgio Lucidi about Apache ManifoldCF and Incubation</a></li>

</ul>
<p>This was a great event to attend and meet others in the open source world.</p>
<h3 id="mesoscon-europe">MesosCon Europe <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#mesoscon-europe">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Apache Mesos community were happy to have an Apache presence with a booth and also a keynote presentation from Rich
Bowen. Feedback on the keynote was very positive and many people were interested to learn about the Foundation itself
and Apache as the work it does to support its projects.</p>
<p>Quite a few people stopped by our booth to collect stickers and talk to us not only about Mesos but other Apache
projects that they used or were familiar with. We also received several enquiries about future ApacheCons. Rich took a
short video of us all on duty at the Apache booth:</p>
<p><a href="https://t.co/f7H9qRgYYh">Apache Booth Duty</a></p>
<p>Thank you to everyone that helped out on booth duty or supported us at the event especially to the Apache Mesos
community for inviting us.</p>
<h3 id="comdev-jira">Comdev Jira <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#comdev-jira">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Community Development has a Jira instance that we use to track tasks and issues. Over the last few months it hasn&rsquo;t been
fully utlised so we have decided to revitalise it and start using it again to help us manage things we are working on.
Some initial cleanup of old and existing tasks is needed and this is currently in progress.</p>
<p>Those of you subscribed to our dev mailing list may have noticed the that the Jira notifications are now appearing there
when an issue or task is updated. This has been done to enable better communication so that everyone can see the
progress on any specific task. So far this has been been successful and people who see a task that they can help with
are volunteering to make a contribution.</p>
<p>If you would like to see if you can help us with any of our open issues and tasks then please take a look at our Jira
list</p>

<h3 id="asf-brochures">ASF Brochures <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#asf-brochures">&para;</a></h3>
<p>An ASF brochure was put together for the OpenExpo in Spain earlier this year and was available in English and Spanish. A
German language version was later created for our participation at the Solutions Hamburg conference. With the help of
our contributors the brochure has now been translated into several other languages including Italian, Catalan, French,
Russian, Japanese and we have a Chinese translation on the way.</p>
<p>These brochures are available for anyone running or attending an event that need to information about the ASF for
attendees. People can download and print the details they need.</p>
<p>You can find the brochure in the various translations can be found on the Wiki at the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/ASF+Information+Brochure">ASF Information Brochures</a></p>
<p>We are still looking for volunteers to if you would like to help translate the brochure into yet another language then
please contact us.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-summit-paris">Open Source Summit Paris <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#open-source-summit-paris">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Open Source Summit in Paris is planned for 6th and 7th December and we have been given a booth. . The event schedule
has a mix of French and English speaking presentations and we have recruited some French speaking volunteers to help out
on our booth.</p>
<p>We have also been given a half day track and the details are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous Decision Making - why and how - Bertrand Delacretaz</li>
<li>IoT using Apache Spark and Apache Bahir - Luciano Resende</li>
<li>Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) + Geospatial Standards - Martin Desruisseaux</li>
<li>Apache Beam: Portable and efficient data-intensive processing - Ismaël Mejía</li>
<li>DevOps for Apache OFBiz using Jenkins and Selenium - Olivier Heinz</li>
</ul>
<p>and we also a keynote slot that will be presented by Bertrand Delacretaz.</p>
<p>This is a new event for us and it is great that we have some talks on the schedule. We are looking forward to being
there and talking to attendees about Apache. The conference is completely free to attend but you do need to register on
the conference website. More information can be found
at: <a href="https://www.opensourcesummit.paris/">www.opensourcesummit.paris</a></p>
<h3 id="fosdem">FOSDEM <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#fosdem">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We have requested an Apache booth for next year&rsquo;s FOSDEM conference in Brussels. The decisions will be announced in late
November so we are hoping that we will be allocated a place.</p>
<p>Based on feedback from the community, we put together a FOSDEM devroom proposal but unfortunately it was unsuccessful.
However FOSDEM will have a <a href="https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2017-October/002610.html">Community Devroom</a> again
next year so we are encouraging people to make submissions to this devroom on any community related topic. You can find
details of the CFP and how to submit a talk proposal at the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM18">CFP for FOSDEM Community Devroom</a></p>
<p>Deadlines for submissions is 27th November 2017 so if you are interested in presenting, then please get your proposals in now.</p>
<h3 id="new-pmc-chair">New PMC Chair <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#new-pmc-chair">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We have decided to rotate our PMC Chair. Uli Stark has held the role for a while and it is general practice for projects
to rotate the role within the PMC. Sharan Foga has now been appointed the new PMC Chair for Community Development.Many
thanks to Uli for all his hard work and effort as VP ComDev over the last few years and also congratulations to Sharan
on her new role.</p>
<h3 id="apache-community-business-cards">Apache Community Business Cards <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#apache-community-business-cards">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This month we started
a <a href="https://s.apache.org/111l">discussion about the introduction of Apache Community business cards</a>. The idea is that
people could have Apache style business cards that could be given out to people. For example, if you are at an event
representing your Apache role or project or if you are volunteering at the ASF booth and want to give your contact
Apache details to someone you have been speaking to.</p>
<p>Individuals (not the ASF) would be responsible for the cost of printing their own cards.
The <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/Community+Business+Cards">two suggested card formats</a> are now on
the Comdev wiki and we will be promoting their use to committers and projects.</p>
