	<p>Welcome to our monthly blog update about what is happening in Apache Community Development (ComDev)!</p>
<p>This month we have news about our participation at FOSDEM, we include an update on Apachecon North America and our
Apache EU Roadshow events, we continue to actively look for event sponsors, we prepare to take part in GSoC and we
welcome another PMC member.</p>
<h3 id="fosdem">FOSDEM <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#fosdem">&para;</a></h3>
<p>During February, we participated at <a href="http://fosdem.org/2018">FOSDEM</a>. FOSDEM is a open source conference held in
Brussels every year. It is completely free to attend and attracts around 4000-5000 attendees. We were allocated a booth
at the event which has been a great way for projects to promote themselves to new users or potential new contributors,
and also to spread the word about Apache.</p>
<p>In preparation, a wiki page was setup with booth volunteers could register and projects could book time on the ASF booth
to promote their project. Following on from last year&rsquo;s feedback, this year we had some larger roller banners, one with
our feather logo and one with our list of projects. Once again people were surprised to realise just how many projects
we have at the ASF or that they were already using. We also had a few project demos running via a monitor at the booth.
Visitors often want to find out more details about a project or see it in action so having a visual display really
helped us interact with the attendees. It was good to see the <a href="http://kibble.apache.org/">Apache Kibble</a> demo was
getting a lot of attention not only from conference visitors but also from other Apache projects too.</p>
<p>As usual, people came by to pick up stickers, and giveaway items. This year our items were a little different, we had
some Apache balloons, Apache pens, bracelets t,-shirts and some mugs that became a most wanted item. There were also
quite a few Apache project related presentations which also help generate a wider awareness of the Foundation.</p>
<p>A big thank you to everyone who turned up to help out on the booth or to chat to people about their projects. Special
mentions goes to all the booth volunteers (Daan, Rohit, Trevor, Myrle, Andrus, Kevin, Rich, Daniel, Pono, Bertrand and
Isabel).</p>
<h3 id="apachecon-na-2018">Apachecon NA 2018 <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#apachecon-na-2018">&para;</a></h3>

<h3 id="actively-seeking-sponsors">Actively Seeking Sponsors <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#actively-seeking-sponsors">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We are actively looking for sponsors to help sponsor our <a href="http://apachecon.com/acna18/">Apachecon North America</a>

sponsorship packages available then please contact Kevin McGrail on kmcgrail AT apache DOT org</p>
<h3 id="new-pmc-member">New PMC Member <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#new-pmc-member">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Apache Community Development PMC is pleased to announce another new PMC member this month. Olivier Heintz has been
involved with open source at Apache for several years and has shown himself to be positive and enthusiastic in helping
others learn about how the ASF works.</p>
<p>We are sure that Olivier will be a great addition to the PMC so please join us in welcoming Olivier to the team.</p>
<h3 id="mentoring-at-google-summer-of-code-2018">Mentoring at Google Summer of Code 2018 <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#mentoring-at-google-summer-of-code-2018">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We are involved in the next Google Summer of Code (GSoC) as one of the Mentoring Organizations for the 13th consecutive
year!</p>
<p>The GSoC program allow students to spend their summer (three months and full time) working on an Open Source project.
They can learn how to work in a team on a stable project, they can increase their technical skills but the most
important skill is the understanding of how an Open Source community work to deliver a common and spontaneous effort for
the public good.</p>
<p>You will find us with our own page in
the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5718432427802624/">GSoC program website</a> and here you will find
all <a href="http://s.apache.org/gsoc2018ideas">our project ideas</a> designed by each PMC for giving an opportunity to any student
to start their first journey in one of the Apache projects.</p>
<p>For any student that wants to join the program and for ASF people that want to be a mentor, please take a look
at <a href="https://community.apache.org/gsoc.html">our GSoC page</a> for more useful information.</p>
<p>Proposals registrations from students are allowed starting on 12th March but any student is invited to get in touch with
us leaving a comment on our JIRA or in the mailing list related to the chosen ASF project.</p>
