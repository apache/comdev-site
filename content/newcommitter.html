<p>When voting, all PMC members need to make up their own minds as to whether a candidate
should be approved to become a committer. They might search mailing lists and Jira to see
how the candidate interacts with others, and the contributions (code or doc patches, suggestions, engagement in conversation) they have made.</p>
<p>All new committers <strong>must</strong> adhere to the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html">Apache Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Each PMC may want to create their own supplemental committer guidelines,
such as a minimum number of contributions, or number of months active on
the project. We encourage you to not make this bar artificially high.</p>
<p>The following are some points to consider when assessing a candidate&rsquo;s qualifications for committership.</p>

later in this document.</p>
<p><a name="NewCommitter-Summary"></a></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#summary">&para;</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Discuss the proposed committer (and optionally PMC member). If the discussion seems to be going positively,
call a vote following the template below.</li>
<li>Close the vote following the template below</li>
<li>If the result is positive, invite the new committer following the template below.</li>
</ol>
<p>If they accept, then:</p>
<ol>
<li>If they already have an Apache id, grant appropriate commit privileges.
Use the Whimsy tool to update the roster via <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committee/">Comitee Roster</a> or
<a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/ppmc/">PPMC Roster</a></li>
<li>If they have already filed an ICLA, request creation of the committer account.
If they need to change anything in a previously filed ICLA, wait until the new ICLA is filed,
then request the account.
<ol>
<li>Wait until root says it is done</li>
<li>PMC Chair updates LDAP group membership which enables svn, gitbox and other access.
If the committer uses GitHub, they are responsible for linking it to their ASF account.</li>
<li>Add committer to the appropriate groups in Jira and CWiki</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Notify the committer of completion following the template below</li>
<li>If committer is also to be a PMC member, PMC Chair or another PMC member sends email to board@ notifying
about the PMC member. See [new PMC member](<a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newpmcmember%5D">https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newpmcmember]</a></li>
<li>Announce the new committer following the template below.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="NewCommitter-Discussion"></a></p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#discussion">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We do the discussion and vote on the <code>private@</code> mailing list to enable a frank
discussion. Any PMC member may propose a potential committer or PMC
member. This is <strong>not</strong> the sole responsibility or right of the PMC
chair.</p>
<p>We invite people to join as committers/PMC members, not github ids. It is
fine to refer to the candidate&rsquo;s github id for context, but the person should
be referred to by their name. It is not necessary to have their full legal
name (that will be kept private) but it is important to use their name, as
they refer to themselves in email. If a person is known only by their github
id, it is ok to ask them for their real name prior to holding a VOTE.</p>
<p>Start a separate [VOTE] thread for each new person. This makes it much easier
to review the email archives.</p>
<p>We need to be sure that they are committed people with whom we can work.
They will be our peers. We will have already observed that they are
committed to the project and graceful toward users and other developers.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait too long before proposing and don&rsquo;t be too hasty. There is a
trade-off and something about timeliness. A point is reached where it
becomes obvious that we should invite them. This encourages them and keeps
them enthusiastic. If we leave it too long, then we risk them becoming
disillusioned.</p>
<p>On the <code>private@</code> list we can each say exactly what we feel about each person,
with no holds barred. Keep the discussion concise. The praise part can
be done later in public. Keep in mind, however, that if the member becomes
a PMC member later, they will have access to this discussion.</p>
<p>Let the Vote thread run for one week.</p>
<p>A positive result is achieved by <strong>Consensus Approval</strong>: at least 3 +1
votes and no vetoes.</p>
<p>Any veto must be accompanied by reasoning and the vetoer must be prepared to defend it.
Other members can attempt to encourage them to change their mind.</p>
<p>New committers can be either quiet or active as they choose. If we find
that certain people lapse and don&rsquo;t ever contribute, then the project can take steps
to retire them.</p>
<p>After a positive result, record the result on the PMC list with a <code>[RESULT][VOTE]</code> subject
and then invite the candidate. We give candidates a chance to decline committership in private. They
can post a reply to the PMC mailing list.</p>
<p>After we reach a decision on the <code>private@</code> list, and after the steps above, we
announce the new committer on the <code>dev</code> list. We can then each follow up with
our praise in public.</p>
<p>Other notes about the process are available on the main <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newcommitter">Apache site</a>.</p>

Subject: Invitation to become [PROJECT] committer: Jo Bloggs

Hello [invitee name],

The [Project] Project Management Committee (PMC)
hereby offers you committer privileges to the project
[If your project automatically adds committers as PMC members]
as well as membership in the PMC
[/if]
These privileges are offered on the understanding that you'll use them
reasonably and with common sense. We like to work on trust
rather than unnecessary constraints.

Being a committer enables you to more easily make
changes without needing to go through the patch
submission process. [Being a PMC member enables you
to guide the direction of the project.]

Being a committer does not require you to
participate any more than you already do. It does
tend to make one even more committed.  You will
probably find that you spend more time here.

Of course, you can decline and instead remain as a
contributor, participating as you do now.

This personal invitation is a chance for you to accept or decline in private.
Please let us know in reply to this message whether you accept or decline.

If you accept, you will need an Apache account (id) with privileges.
Please follow these instructions.

A. If you already have an ICLA on file:

    1. If you already have an Apache account, let us know your id and we
will grant you privileges on the project repositories.

    2. If you have previously sent an ICLA, let us know the email address
and public name used on the ICLA and your preferred Apache id, and
we will request your account.

    3. If the email address on the previously submitted ICLA is no longer
valid, let us know the email address and public name used on the new ICLA,
and your preferred Apache id. Continue to step B below and file your new ICLA.

Look to see if your preferred ID is already taken at
https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html

B. If there is not already an ICLA on file, you need to submit an ICLA:

    1. Details of the ICLA and the forms are found
    through this link: https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

    2. Instructions for its completion and return to
    the Secretary of the ASF are found at
    https://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html#submitting

    Do not copy the project or any other individual on your message
    to Secretary, as the form contains Personally Identifiable Information
    that should be kept private.

    3. When you complete the ICLA form, be sure to include in the form
    the Apache [Project] project and choose a
    unique Apache ID. Look to see if your preferred
    ID is already taken at
    https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html
    This will allow the Secretary to notify the PMC
    when your ICLA has been recorded.

When recording of your ICLA is noted, you will
receive a follow-up message with the next steps for
establishing you as a committer.

<h3 id="committer-account-creation">Committer Account Creation <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#committer-account-creation">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newcommitter">account creation instructions</a>.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<p>If the ICLA identifies the project and a valid Apache ID, and the
<code>[RESULT][VOTE]</code> message has been posted to the PMC private list,
the account creation request is made by the
secretary or assistant secretary who files the ICLA.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the new account request should be made by the
PMC Chair (or any <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#Member">ASF Member</a>
if the chair is unavailable).</p>
<p>The PMC chair needs to use the <a href="https://id.apache.org/acreq/pmc-chairs/">ASF New Account Request</a> form to
send a new account request. Members may use <a href="https://id.apache.org/acreq/members/">ASF New Account Request</a> page.</p>
<p>For elections held on public lists, please supply the
<a href="https://mail-archives.apache.org/">Mail archives</a> url. For private lists, you can
use the <a href="https://mail-search.apache.org/">Mail Search tool</a> to locate the appropriate url.</p>

To: private@[PROJECT].a.o, ###JoBloggs@foo.net
Subject: account request: ###Jo Bloggs

####, as you know, the ASF Infrastructure has set up your
committer account with the username '####'.

Please follow the instructions to set up your SSH,
svn password, svn configuration, email forwarding, etc.
https://www.apache.org/dev/#committers

[If your project automatically adds committers as PMC members]
Please subscribe to the [PROJECT] Project Management
Committee mailing list private@[PROJECT].apache.org.
[/If]

You have commit access to specific sections of the
ASF repository, as follows:

[PROJECT] has various resources at:
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/[PROJECT]
  https://gitbox.apache.org

The general &quot;committers&quot; at:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers

If using svn, you will probably need to 'svn switch&quot; previous checkouts to now use https,
for example:

svn switch --relocate https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/[PROJECT] https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/[PROJECT]

The developer section of the website describes roles within the ASF and provides other
resources:
  https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html
  https://www.apache.org/dev/

The incubator also has some useful information for new committers
in incubating projects:
  https://incubator.apache.org/guides/committer.html
  https://incubator.apache.org/guides/ppmc.html

Just as before you became a committer, participation in any ASF community
requires adherence to the ASF Code of Conduct:
  https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html

[PROJECT should insert its own guidelines here; if none are available,
 the Apache Forrest guidelines are available as a template.]
  https://forrest.apache.org/guidelines.html

If you have any questions during this phase, then please
see the following resources:

Apache developer's pages: https://www.apache.org/dev/
Incubator committer guide: https://incubator.apache.org/guides/committer.html

Naturally, if you don't understand anything be sure to ask us on the [PROJECT] dev mailing list.
Documentation is maintained by volunteers and hence can be out-of-date and incomplete - of course
you can now help fix that.

A PMC member will announce your election to the dev list soon.
