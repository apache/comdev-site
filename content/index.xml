      <description>“I was able to make my first contribution yesterday, and today it was merged. I&amp;rsquo;m so excited about my first steps in open source&amp;quot;, a participant said about the First Summit for Open Source Contributors, which took place this September in Guadalajara, México. How do you involve others in open source? How can we make this space more inclusive for groups with low representation in the field?
With these questions in mind and the call to contribute to software that is powering the world&amp;rsquo;s favorite products, the Apache Software Foundation, along with the CNCF, sponsored the First Summit for Open Source Contributors in Mexico.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of magic happening in the IoT sector at the moment. A lot of new projects are appearing and older projects are growing and extending their functionality. We have noticed that it&amp;rsquo;s currently quite difficult to keep track who the players in this field are and what they&amp;rsquo;re up to. So we decided to create a new mailing-list to help improve the communication:
iot@apache.org (Archive at: https://lists.apache.org/list.html?iot@apache.org)
We hope this communication-channel will help reduce unnecessary double-work and improve streamlining the projects to work together as good a possible.</description>

      <description>Apache Beam has been a top-level project since January 2017. I, current Beam PMC Chair, would like to share some of Beam&amp;rsquo;s recent efforts to tackle the challenges of growing our community.
[Updated Feb 27, 2019 to clarify that the article is authored by the Beam PMC Chair and describes the Beam project&amp;rsquo;s work to build their own community. Previously it could have mistakenly been read as an ASF Foundation statement about the Beam project, or as describing an ASF action taken upon the Beam project.</description>

      <title>Who should use Apache Extras?</title>
      <link>https://community.apache.org/blog/who_should_use_apache_extras.html</link>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/blog/who_should_use_apache_extras.html</guid>
      <description>This is historical content, not relevant anymore but kept here as an archive.Who should host their projects on Apache Extras?
Apache Extras is aimed primarily those who are unable or unwilling to licence their code under the Apache License V2, but want to signal their relationship to one or more Apache project community.
One example of this is my own Drupal connector for Apache Wookie (Incubating). This needs to be GPL licensed due to the Drupal dependency, but it contains Apache Licensed code as well.</description>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/blog/why_apache_extras.html</guid>
      <description>This is historical content, not relevant anymore but kept here as an archive.All Apache projects use the same pragmatic software license, the Apache License v2. However, we recognise that there are other FOSS licences out there, some of which are incompatible with the Apache License v2.
Code under these licenses cannot be hosted on Apache servers, but people sometimes choose to, or are required to, use them.
Until the launch of apache-extras these projects had no a single home to go to.</description>

      <title>How Apache Projects Use Consensus</title>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/blog/how_apache_projects_use_consensus.html</guid>
      <description>The Apache Software Foundation exists to provide legal and technological infrastructure for open source projects. By and large, the Foundation leaves the individual project communities to make their own choices about their development process. There are some constraints that result from the fundamental legal umbrella held by the Foundation. For the Foundation to protect contributors, projects must respect the rules regarding IP management and releases. A more interesting set of constraints, however, stems from the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s commitment to Open Source software development as a communal process.</description>

      <guid>https://community.apache.org/blog/what_makes_apache_projects_different.html</guid>
      <description>Sharing a code repository with some other programmers might seem enough to create an open source project; the Apache Software Foundation goes further and focuses on making projects sustainable in the long term, and ensuring that our code is legally clean.
This means that our projects have to follow a (small) number of rules, and a number of best practices have been established over the years.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick description of how Apache projects are born and live on - some of the items below are derived from the ASF&amp;rsquo;s bylaws (http://www.</description>

      <description>The Apache Project Maturity Model provides a suggested framework for evaluating the overall maturity of an Apache project community and the codebase that it maintains. While this model is specific to projects of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), many of these factors apply to any open source project.
Overview &amp;para; The goals of this maturity model are to describe how Apache projects operate in a concise and high-level way, and to provide a basic framework that projects may choose to use to evaluate themselves.</description>

      <description>Almost everything and everyone at Apache use email lists to get work done, including this Community Development project right here! When people send email to a list, many other community members get the message, and someone usually provides a useful reply. Every email list at Apache is archived: most lists are archived publicly. That means that newcomers to a community can learn how decisions on a project have been made in the past, because all the email discussions a project has had are archived.</description>

      <description>The most important thing about engaging with any Apache project is that everyone is equal. All project participants with an opinion can express that opinion and, where appropriate, have the community consider it.
To some, the idea of having to establish consensus in a large and distributed team sounds inefficient and frustrating. Don&amp;rsquo;t despair, though: The Apache Way has a set of simple processes to ensure things proceed at a good pace.</description>

      <description>Some Apache committers have successfully run funding campaigns to support their work on their favorite Apache projects.
This is ok in principle, but you have to make it clear that the campaign is your own thing, and avoid any confusion about the role of the ASF and how its projects work.
This page gives a few examples of how to do that.

      <description>What are &amp;ldquo;Good First Issues&amp;rdquo;? &amp;para; &amp;ldquo;Good First Issues&amp;rdquo; are a good way to start on an OSS project, and an official Github initiative. Several GitHub repositories use this label to encourage new contributors to start helping the project without the necessity, in most cases, to contact one of the contributors in advance or to have a deep knowledge of the project architecture or content.
How can I identify a &amp;ldquo;Good First Issue&amp;rdquo;?</description>

      <description>A comprehensive guide to being a GSoC admin for the ASF
List of duties:
Make sure the ASF has an extensive list of project ideas ready shortly after Google announces the program (around the end of January). Projects must create Jira issues for their ideas and label them with gsoc2024; and mentor. If a project doesn&amp;rsquo;t use Jira, have them create the ideas in the GSOC Jira project. Create a Jira filter for these ideas to use in the application (see next).</description>

      <description>Having identified a Top Level Project (TLP) and an issue you would like to work on, it is a good idea to introduce yourself to the project community and outline your plans for tackling the issue. This lets the community know you are working on the issue and gives the community an early opportunity to help course correct your proposal, if necessary (which can save you lots of time).
Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what your first email might look like:</description>

      <description>The ASF has a long tradition of using mailing lists as the primary communication format in projects. This is not merely because we&amp;rsquo;ve always done it that way, but is an intentional decision for the health and sustainability of our communities.

(So that we didn&amp;rsquo;t put them all in the first edition)
If you blog about anything Apache related, you might want to know about http://planet.apache.org/committers/ - the Apache committer blog aggregator. It’s valuable in seeing what the rest of the Apache community is working on. To add yourself to the planet, edit the file https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/planet/committers.ini in svn. It’s preferable if you use an ‘apache’ tag to separate out the stuff that is relevant to the community.</description>

      <description>This page describes the ranking process The Apache Software Foundation uses to evaluate mentee proposals.
The ranking process makes sure the most promising applicants get a mentor with an ASF project. The goal is not to identify the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; projects for the ASF, but the best mentees who have applied to the ASF.
Remember, mentoring is all about the mentee and open source as a whole. It is not about the mentors or their projects.</description>

      <description>Mentoring: First Patch &amp;para; A beginner&amp;rsquo;s first patch on a project can be an intimidating and frustrating experience. Clearly documenting the entire process from checkout to accepted patch greatly lowers the barrier for a new contributor, and makes it more likely that they&amp;rsquo;ll come back for their second patch.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some tips on how to do that.
Outline:
Talk to the project first Make sure it&amp;rsquo;s wanted/welcome See if there&amp;rsquo;s already work in progress, or suggestions Find someone to be your advocate Finding the source Writing a good commit message Following up on your pull request Learning from your struggle: Improving the documentation </description>

      <description>Identifying potential new committers, calling a vote for their recognition as a committer and processing the relevant documents are tasks to which the whole community can contribute.
Each project has a different approach to managing new committers. This page describes a common process found in many Apache projects. It also provides drafts for the various communications that are necessary.
Some of the PMCs automatically make committers PMC members. The templates below have conditional [if] clauses for that.</description>
