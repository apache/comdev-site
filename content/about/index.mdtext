## Community Development: What We Do

"Community Development" Is a very broad term, and means different things
to different people. The Community Development (ComDev) project 
provides a wide array of information, [FAQs](https://community.apache.org/newbiefaq.html), and help to newcomers as
well as existing committers, and maintains a number of [helpful tools](#getcode).

### Tools And Code We Maintain ### {#getcode}

ComDev manages a number of helpful tools for finding your way around.

  - The [Apache Projects Directory](https://projects.apache.org/) lists all our software technologies.  [See the Project Directory **code**](https://projects.apache.org/about.html) and the JSON data feeds available.
  - [Apache Committer Phone Book](http://home.apache.org/) lists all individual Apache committers.  [See the Phonebook **code**](https://home.apache.org/phonebook-about.html).
  - Some projects [ask for Help Wanted](http://helpwanted.apache.org/) with easy-to-get-started tasks or bugs for newcomers.  [See the HelpWanted **code**](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/comdev/helpwanted.apache.org/).
  - The [Project Reporting Tool](https://reporter.apache.org/) (requires login), that helps Apache PMCs create quarterly board reports.  [See the Reporter **code**](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/projects.apache.org/).
  - A [ComDev Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/ComDev+Wiki) is also available for scratch or experimental work, although most permanent content should be here in the CMS.

Each of the above tools is maintained by the ComDev PMC, so bring questions to the dev@ list.
