      <description>Approval of small Apache-related events The Community Development PMC is responsible for assisting with the organisation and promotion of all Apache events.
Organizers of Apache-related events need approval for using the Apache trademarks in their event brandings.
The main steps are:
a) Get approval from the PMCs of the projects that your event is about.
b) Abide by the Apache branding rules.
c) Once brand use is approved by the respective PMCs, inform the community development PMC of your event, including references to PMCs approval.</description>
