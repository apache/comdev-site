<p>What&rsquo;s involved in being a director at the ASF? This document tries to give an
overview of the time commitment involved, and what the work looks like.</p>
<p>The official duties of the Board are defined <a href="https://apache.org/foundation/governance/board.html">on the Apache Governance
website</a>. You
should read that doc, and those to which it links, first.</p>
<p>This document tries to give a little more flavor, for the benefit of
someone who&rsquo;s considering running for their first term as a Director.</p>
<h1 id="work-load">Work Load <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#work-load">&para;</a></h1>
<h2 id="monthly-meeting">Monthly meeting <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#monthly-meeting">&para;</a></h2>
<p>As with most things in open source, you can spend as much time on them
as you want, and pursue your individual passions. However, being a
director does carry certain basic responsibilities.
You are expected to attend the board meeting, once a month. This meeting
can run from a half hour or more, depending on the issues to be discussed
in that particular month.</p>
<p>The shortest board meeting ran less than 15 minutes, while the longest
ones have been upwards of two hours. Typical meetings run about one hour.</p>
<p>Note that meeting times are chosen by the directors, and so tend to be
placed at times that are convenient to the majority of the currently
sitting directors. That is to say, the meetings tend to be at times that
are inconvenient to people living in underrepresented parts of the
world.  Meetings are held on the third Thursday of a month.</p>
<h2 id="pre-meeting-work">Pre-meeting work <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#pre-meeting-work">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Most of the work of a board meeting happens before the meeting starts,
as discussed in the <a href="https://apache.org/foundation/governance/board.html">formal
documentation</a>.<br>
Many projects and officers submit their reports to the agenda a week
before the meeting, meaning directors have time beforehand to read
and comment on most reports.</p>
<p>The Incubator report, in particular, consists of the podling reports
for all active incubation efforts, and so is effectively a dozen reports
on its own.</p>
<p>In a typical month, there will be between 70 and 90 individual board
reports. In addition to that, there are a dozen officers reports,
various special orders, and following up on action items.</p>
<p>If you review each of your shepherd projects in depth, and attempt to read
and comment on all of the other projects, this can take from several
hours to a couple of days.</p>
<p>Each director is assigned N/9 projects to shepherd, where N is the number
of projects reporting that month. As of January 2024, this works out to
roughly 7 or 8 shepherd projects per director.</p>
<h2 id="post-meeting-work">Post-meeting work <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#post-meeting-work">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Reports that result in action items will require followup. This may just
be sending an email message, and then checking back on it a few days
later. Or it might be a significant quantity of work.</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate what time will be required to handle these
items, as it varies greatly from one month to the next, and with the
complexity of the issues involved.</p>
<p>Shepherds are normally expected to take the lead on any board issues
relating to the reports they were assigned that month.  Shepherd
assignments are random each month, which helps to ensure that over
a year&rsquo;s board term each director reads a variety of reports.</p>
<h2 id="face-to-face-meetings">Face-to-face meetings <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#face-to-face-meetings">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Most years, the new board of directors will be asked to attend a
face-to-face meeting. This is in part to meet and learn how best to work
together. It&rsquo;s also largely to get an idea of what the various
directors&rsquo; priorities are for that year.</p>
<p>This is typically a two-day meeting, plus travel time to and from the
meeting venue. The venue is chosen to minimize travel time and distance
for the largest number of participants.</p>
<p>Travel costs can be covered by the ASF, if needed, for directors and
officers who are expected to attend those face-to-face meetings.</p>
<h2 id="between-meetings">Between meetings <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#between-meetings">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The board communicates on the <a href="mailto:board@apache.org">board@apache.org</a> mailing list, which is
visible to all ASF members and PMC chairs. On very rare occasions,
confidential discussions are handled on the board-private mail alias,
however, use of that is discouraged.</p>
<p>Directors are expected to check the board mailing list regularly, keep
up with discussions there, and weigh in on those discussions, as this is
where the business of the Foundation is conducted.</p>
<h1 id="legal-and-liability-issues">Legal and Liability issues <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#legal-and-liability-issues">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Apache is a 501c3 non-profit corporation in the state of Delaware.
The Directors have fiduciary and legal responsibilities relating to
Delaware and US law.  These include a duty of care and duty of loyalty
to the organization itself; primarily ensuring that directors are
informed about the issues, and are acting in the best interests of
the organization as a whole (and it&rsquo;s public charity benefit).</p>
<p>While the majority of work as directors involves working with our
project communities or considering policy questions, things like
voting for the annual budget and other financial issues are definitely
things covered by Delaware law.</p>
<p>Useful overviews of the legal responsibilities include:</p>
