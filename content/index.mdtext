<h2>Apache Community Development!</h2>
<br>

<p>Mission: The Community Development project creates and provides tools,
processes, and advice, to help open source software projects improve their own
community health.

We are, of course, primarily focused on Apache Software Foundation
projects. However, because we believe that the Apache Way is, in fact, the
best way to manage a software project, we strive also to make these
artifacts releasable to the open source community as a whole. </p>

<p>We do not focus on
specific projects here, but rather on the common processes and policies
called The Apache Way found in most Apache projects. Our goal is to help you
<em>understand how the ASF works</em> and give you the confidence to participate
in the specific Apache projects that interest you.</p>

        talks about the difference between ASF Members and project committers, who decides things (voting), how elections take place, how our infrastructure is setup, what is the board, what is a PMC, what's the philosophy behind the incubator.</p>

        <h4>How To Ask Questions</h4>
        <p>All Apache projects use <a href="https://lists.apache.org/">publicly archived mailing lists</a> that anyone may subscribe
           to and/or ask questions related to that Apache project.  Most projects have a
           dev@project.apache.org mailing list for technical discussions about the code, and a
           user@ or users@ mailing list for questions about the product or features.
           <br/><br/>
           We have a <a href="http://community.apache.org/contributors/etiquette">Code of Conduct and Etiquette guidelines</a> to help you write good emails.
           <br/><br/>
           The ComDev project has our own mailing list where you can ask general questions
           about Apache at <a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@community.apache.org:lte=3M:">dev@community.apache.org</a>.</p>

          <h4>Google Summer of Code program (GSoC)</h4>
          <p>The Community Development project also manages the <a href="gsoc.html">ASF's participation in the Google Summer of Code program</a>. Each year, since 2005, we've taken on between 30 and 45 students. Many of these have gone on to be long term committers and even members of the foundation.
