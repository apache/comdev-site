Subject: [DISCUSS] New PMC member: [Candidate Name]

I propose to add [Candidate Name] as a PMC member.

[State reasons that you believe they are a good candidate]

[State contribution statistics, if available and relevant.]

PMC members are our peers, who help drive the direction of this
project. They will be owners not just of the code, but of the project
and its brand.

Please remember that should this candidate be elected, they will have
access to our archives, and be able to read this, so phrase your
comments constructively with this in mind.
