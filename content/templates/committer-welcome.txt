Subject: Welcome, [First Name], New Committer!

Hello, [Committer Name],

As you know, the ASF Infrastructure has set up your committer account
with the username `[apacheID]`

[If your project uses GitHub]
You will now be able to merge approved PRs on GitHub for this project.
(You'll need to associate your GitHub account with your Apache email
address.)

You can manage your account settings at https://id.apache.org/
[/If GitHub]

[If your project uses SVN]
svn password, svn configuration, email forwarding, etc.
https://www.apache.org/dev/#committers

[PROJECT] has various resources at:
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/[PROJECT]
[/If SVN]

[If your project automatically adds committers as PMC members]
Please subscribe to the [PROJECT] Project Management
Committee mailing list private@[PROJECT].apache.org.
[/If PMC]

The developer section of the website describes roles within the ASF and 
provides other resources:
  https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html
  https://www.apache.org/dev/

The incubator also has some useful information for new committers
in incubating projects:
  https://incubator.apache.org/guides/committer.html
  https://incubator.apache.org/guides/ppmc.html

You now have expanded access to portions of the Whimsy toolset
specific to committers: https://whimsy.apache.org/

As an ASF committer, you now also have commit access to specific
sections of the ASF Foundation repository, as follows:

The general "committers" at:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers

Just as before you became a committer, participation in any ASF community
requires adherence to the ASF Code of Conduct:
  https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html

If you have any questions during this phase, then please
see the following resources:

Apache developer's pages: https://www.apache.org/dev/
Incubator committer guide: https://incubator.apache.org/guides/committer.html

Naturally, if you don't understand anything be sure to ask us on the 
[PROJECT] dev mailing list. Documentation is maintained by volunteers 
and hence can be out-of-date and incomplete - of course you can now
help fix that.

A PMC member will announce your election to the dev list, and we
encourage you to introduce yourself there.

[Your Name]
On behalf of the [Project] PMC
