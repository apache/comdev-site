Subject: [DISCUSS] New committer: [Candidate Name]

I propose to add [Candidate Name] as a committer.

[State reasons that you believe they are a good candidate.]

[State contribution statistics, if available and relevant.]

Please remember that should this candidate be elected as a PMC member
at some later date, they will have access to our archives, and be able
to read this, so phrase your comments constructively with this in mind.
