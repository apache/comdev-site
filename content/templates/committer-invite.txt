Subject: Invitation to become [PROJECT] committer: [Candidate Name]

Hello [Candidate Name],

The [Project] Project Management Committee (PMC)
hereby offers you committer privileges to the project
[If your project automatically adds committers as PMC members]
as well as membership in the PMC
[/if]
These privileges are offered on the understanding that you'll use them
reasonably and with common sense. We like to work on trust
rather than unnecessary constraints.

Being a committer enables you to more easily make
changes without needing to go through the patch
submission process. [Being a PMC member enables you
to guide the direction of the project.]

Being a committer does not require you to
participate any more than you already do. It does
tend to make one even more committed.  You will
probably find that you spend more time here.

Of course, you can decline and instead remain as a
contributor, participating as you do now.

This personal invitation is a chance for you to accept or decline in private.
Please let us know in reply to this message whether you accept or decline.

If you accept, you will need an Apache account (id) with privileges.
Please follow these instructions.

A. If you already have an ICLA on file:

    1. If you already have an Apache account, let us know your id and we
will grant you privileges on the project repositories.

    2. If you have previously sent an ICLA, let us know the email address
and public name used on the ICLA and your preferred Apache id, and
we will request your account.

    3. If the email address on the previously submitted ICLA is no longer
valid, let us know the email address and public name used on the new ICLA,
and your preferred Apache id. Continue to step B below and file your new ICLA.

Look to see if your preferred ID is already taken at
https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html

B. If there is not already an ICLA on file, you need to submit an ICLA:

    1. Details of the ICLA and the forms are found
    through this link: https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

    2. Instructions for its completion and return to
    the Secretary of the ASF are found at
    https://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html#submitting

    Do not copy the project or any other individual on your message
    to Secretary, as the form contains Personally Identifiable Information
    that should be kept private.

    3. When you complete the ICLA form, be sure to include in the form
    the Apache [Project] project and choose a
    unique Apache ID. Look to see if your preferred
    ID is already taken at
    https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html
    This will allow the Secretary to notify the PMC
    when your ICLA has been recorded.

When recording of your ICLA is noted, you will
receive a follow-up message with the next steps for
establishing you as a committer.
