Hello [invitee name],

The [Project] Project Management Committee (PMC)
hereby offers you membership in the PMC. These privileges are offered on
the understanding that you'll use them reasonably and with common sense.
We like to work on trust rather than unnecessary constraints.

This personal invitation is a chance for you to accept or decline in private.
Please let us know in reply to this message whether you accept or decline.
Also, please refrain from sharing that you were invited before the official
announcement by the PMC.

The rights and responsibilities are described here:
https://community.apache.org/pmc/responsibilities.html
If that's in any way unclear, please reach out to me or  any of the
other PMC members for clarification, or to discuss this decision in more
detail.

[Your Name]
On behalf of the [Project] PMC
