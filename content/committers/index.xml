      <description>The most important thing about engaging with any Apache project is that everyone is equal. All project participants with an opinion can express that opinion and, where appropriate, have the community consider it.
To some, the idea of having to establish consensus in a large and distributed team sounds inefficient and frustrating. Don&amp;rsquo;t despair, though: The Apache Way has a set of simple processes to ensure things proceed at a good pace.</description>

      <title>Funding campaign disclaimer</title>

      <description>Some Apache committers have successfully run funding campaigns to support their work on their favorite Apache projects.
This is ok in principle, but you have to make it clear that the campaign is your own thing, and avoid any confusion about the role of the ASF and how its projects work.
This page gives a few examples of how to do that.
If you have any question about this, feel free to ask on our dev@community.</description>

      <description>What are &amp;ldquo;Good First Issues&amp;rdquo;? &amp;para; &amp;ldquo;Good First Issues&amp;rdquo; are a good way to start on an OSS project, and an official Github initiative. Several GitHub repositories use this label to encourage new contributors to start helping the project without the necessity, in most cases, to contact one of the contributors in advance or to have a deep knowledge of the project architecture or content.
How can I identify a &amp;ldquo;Good First Issue&amp;rdquo;?</description>
